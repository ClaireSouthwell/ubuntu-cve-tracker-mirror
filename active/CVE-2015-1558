Description:
 Asterisk Open Source 12.x before 12.8.1 and 13.x before 13.1.1, when using
 the PJSIP channel driver, does not properly reclaim RTP ports, which allows
 remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (file descriptor
 consumption) via an SDP offer containing only incompatible codecs.
