Description:
 The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be
 opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon
 crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation
 of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the
 chroot.
