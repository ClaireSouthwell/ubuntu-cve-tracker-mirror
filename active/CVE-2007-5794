Description:
 Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked
 against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send
 user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP
 connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the
 wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be
 affected.
