Description:
 The (1) tomboy and (2) tomboy-panel scripts in GNOME Tomboy 1.5.2 and
 earlier place a zero-length directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which
 allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse shared library in
 the current working directory.  NOTE: vector 1 exists because of an
 incorrect fix for CVE-2005-4790.2.
