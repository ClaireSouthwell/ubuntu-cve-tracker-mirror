Description:
 common/partial_circular_buffer.cc in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65 does
 not properly handle wraps, which allows remote attackers to bypass a
 sandbox protection mechanism or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
 write) via vectors that trigger a write operation with a large amount of
 data, related to the PartialCircularBuffer::Write and
 PartialCircularBuffer::DoWrite functions.
