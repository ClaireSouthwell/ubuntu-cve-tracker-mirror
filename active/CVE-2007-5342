Description:
 The default catalina.policy in the JULI logging component in Apache Tomcat
 5.5.9 through 5.5.25 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.15 does not restrict certain
 permissions for web applications, which allows attackers to modify logging
 configuration options and overwrite arbitrary files, as demonstrated by
 changing the (1) level, (2) directory, and (3) prefix attributes in the
 org.apache.juli.FileHandler handler.
