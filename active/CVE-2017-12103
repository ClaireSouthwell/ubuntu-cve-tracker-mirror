Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow exists in the way that the Blender
 open-source 3d creation suite v2.78c converts text rendered as a font into
 a curve. A specially crafted .blend file can cause an integer overflow
 resulting in a buffer overflow which can allow for code execution under the
 context of the application. An attacker can convince a user to open the
 file or use the file as a library in order to trigger this vulnerability.
