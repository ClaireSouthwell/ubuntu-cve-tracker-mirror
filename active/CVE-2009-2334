Description:
 wp-admin/admin.php in WordPress and WordPress MU before 2.8.1 does not
 require administrative authentication to access the configuration of a
 plugin, which allows remote attackers to specify a configuration file in
 the page parameter to obtain sensitive information or modify this file, as
 demonstrated by the (1) collapsing-archives/options.txt, (2)
 akismet/readme.txt, (3) related-ways-to-take-action/options.php, (4)
 wp-security-scan/securityscan.php, and (5) wp-ids/ids-admin.php files.
 NOTE: this can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) and denial of
 service.
