Description:
 It was discovered that ICU Layout Engine was missing multiple boundary
 and error return checks.  These could lead to buffer overflows and
 memory corruption.  A specially crafted font file could cause an
 application using ICU to parse untrusted fonts to crash and, possibly,
 execute arbitrary code.
 .
 ICU code is embedded the 2D component in OpenJDK and used by
 FontManager.  An untrusted Java application or applet could use this
 flaw to execute arbitrary code with Java Virtual Machine privileges and
 bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
