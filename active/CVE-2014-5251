Description:
 When MySQL is used to store revocation events, events are returned from
 the database with the timestamps truncated to the second. This causes
 a revocation event for a token (which has the issued_at timestamp to
 the microsecond) to not match the revocation event and therefore the
 token is not considered to be revoked.
