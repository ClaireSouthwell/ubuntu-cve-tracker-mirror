Description:
 GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function
 definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as
 demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd,
 the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts
 executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting
 the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.
 NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> this issue is mitigated by Florian Weimer's prefix-suffix patch
 mdeslaur> that is included in http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2364-1/
 mdeslaur> since bash parser vulnerabilities are now limited to specially
 mdeslaur> named environment variables, and as such are no longer directly
 mdeslaur> exposed to CGI scripts, SSH, etc.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> As of 2014-09-30, there is no official upstream patch for this
 mdeslaur> vulnerability. Once an upstream patch is made available, we
 mdeslaur> will release bash updates, but we don't consider this to be
 mdeslaur> a critical issue requiring immediate attention.
