Description:
 arbitrary code execution with config file parsing
Ubuntu-Description:
 Jesse Michael and Mickey Shkatov discovered that the configuration
 parser in GRUB2 did not properly exit when errors were discovered,
 resulting in heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could
 use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot
 restrictions.
Notes:
 amurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)
  and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low
