Description:
 Apache Tomcat through 8.5.4, when the CGI Servlet is enabled, follows RFC
 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the
 presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable,
 which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound
 HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an
 HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue. NOTE: the vendor states "A mitigation
 is planned for future releases of Tomcat, tracked as CVE-2016-5388"; in
 other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.
