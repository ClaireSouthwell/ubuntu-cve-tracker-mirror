Description:
 LibTIFF 3.9.0 ignores tags in certain situations during the first stage of
 TIFF file processing and does not properly handle this during the second
 stage, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via a crafted file, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2010-2481.
