Description:
 Prior to JSP 2.0, Expression Language (EL) was not supported. To enable the
 use of EL in web applications based on earlier JSP specifications, some Spring
 MVC tags provide EL support independently of the Servlet/JSP container. The
 evaluation of EL is enabled by default. When used on containers that do
 support EL, the attributes can be evaluated for EL twice. Once by the
 container and once by the tag. This can lead to unexpected results that
 include disclosure of information. More details, including a complete list of
 the vulnerable tags and attributes, are available in a paper[1] written by the
 researchers that discovered this issue.
