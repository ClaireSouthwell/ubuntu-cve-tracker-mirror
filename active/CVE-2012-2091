Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in FlightGear 2.6 and earlier and SimGear 2.6 and
 earlier allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a (1) long string in a
 rotor tag of an aircraft xml model to the Rotor::getValueforFGSet function
 in src/FDM/YASim/Rotor.cpp or (2) a crafted UDP packet to the
 SGSocketUDP::read function in simgear/simgear/simgear/io/sg_socket_udp.cxx.
