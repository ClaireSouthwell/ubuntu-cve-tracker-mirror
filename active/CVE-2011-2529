Description:
 chan_sip.c in the SIP channel driver in Asterisk Open Source 1.6.x before
 1.6.2.18.1 and 1.8.x before 1.8.4.3 does not properly handle '\0'
 characters in SIP packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
 via a crafted packet.
