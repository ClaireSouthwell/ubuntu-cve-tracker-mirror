Description:
 The WebPageSerializerImpl::openTagToString function in
 WebKit/Source/web/WebPageSerializerImpl.cpp in the page serializer in
 Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.80 does not properly use HTML entities,
 which might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
 via a crafted document, as demonstrated by a double-quote character inside
 a single-quoted string.
