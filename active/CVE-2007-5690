Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  Buffer overflow in sethdlc.c in the Asterisk Zaptel 1.4.5.1
 might allow local users to gain privileges via a long device name
 (interface name) in the ifr_name field.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this
 issue, stating that the application requires root access, so privilege
 boundaries are not crossed.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 fujitsu> Not a security vulnerability, as the attacker would need to run
 fujitsu> the code as root, so there are no privileges to gain.
