 http://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/b0021673
Description:
 Both the 'sort' and 'dir' parameters to view_all_set.php are
 validated insufficiently before they are used in queries by
 view_all_bug_page.php. Both parameters are split into chunks on
 ','. After splitting, only the first two values are validated. By
 supplying a third value, SQL injection can be performed.
