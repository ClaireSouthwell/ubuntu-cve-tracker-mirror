Description:
 Multiple integer signedness errors in the Dispatch_Write function in
 proxy/dispatcher/idirectfbsurface_dispatcher.c in DirectFB 1.4.13 allow
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via the Voodoo interface, which triggers a stack-based
 buffer overflow.
