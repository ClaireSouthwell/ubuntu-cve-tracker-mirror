Candidate: CVE-2006-3695
References: 
Description:
 Trac before 0.9.6 does not disable the "raw" or "include" commands when
 providing untrusted users with restructured text (reStructuredText)
 functionality from docutils, which allows remote attackers to read
 arbitrary files, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or cause a
 denial of service via unspecified vectors. NOTE: this might be related to
 CVE-2006-3458.
