Description:
 If the broker has exhausted all of its free sockets/file descriptors and
 then a SIGHUP signal is received to trigger reloading of the
 configuration, then the reloading will fail. This results in many of the
 configuration options, including security options, being set to their
 default value. This means that authorisation and access control may no
 longer be in place.
