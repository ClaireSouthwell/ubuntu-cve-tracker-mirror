Description:
 The Mumble client did not properly HTML-escape some external strings before
 using them in a rich-text (HTML) context. In some situations, this could be
 abused to perform a Denial of Service attack (hang and/or resource exhaustion)
 on a Mumble client by causing it to load external files via the HTML.
