Description:
 The cabd_extract function in cabd.c in libmspack before 0.5 does not
 properly maintain decompression callbacks in certain cases where an invalid
 file follows a valid file, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted
 CAB archive.
