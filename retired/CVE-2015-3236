 cURL and libcurl 7.40.0 through 7.42.1 send the HTTP Basic authentication
 credentials for a previous connection when reusing a reset
 (curl_easy_reset) connection handle to send a request to the same host
 name, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via
 unspecified vectors.
