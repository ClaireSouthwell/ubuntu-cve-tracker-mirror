Description:
 ext/gd/gd.c in PHP 5.5.x before 5.5.9 does not check data types, which
 might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by using a (1)
 string or (2) array data type in place of a numeric data type, as
 demonstrated by an imagecrop function call with a string for the x
 dimension value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-7226.
