Description:
 In IPA version 3.0 the session cookie optimization was added to the IPA
 command line client (/usr/bin/ipa) which uses XMLRPC to connect to the
 IPA server and perform the same operations available in the browser
 based web UI of IPA. Unfortunately the command line client failed to
 observe the same rules for cookie security that browsers implement.
 Specifically it failed to check it was sending the session id in the
 cookie to the same URL the session id was received on a secure
 transport
 connection.
