Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the ImageIO component in Oracle Java SE and
 Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, and 1.4.2_25 allows remote
 attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via
 unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the
 March 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable
 researcher that this is an integer overflow in the Java Runtime Environment
 that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a JPEG image
 that contains subsample dimensions with large values.
