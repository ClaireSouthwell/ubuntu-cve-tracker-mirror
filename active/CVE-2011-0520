Description:
 The compress_add_dlabel_points function in dns/Compress.c in MaraDNS
 1.4.03, 1.4.05, and probably other versions allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a long DNS hostname with a large number of labels, which
 triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
