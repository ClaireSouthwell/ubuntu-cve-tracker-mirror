Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling the tag
 esi:when when ESI is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This
 function uses a fixed stack buffer to hold the expression while it's being
 evaluated. When processing the expression, it could either evaluate the top
 of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new member,
 there is no check to ensure that the stack won't overflow.
