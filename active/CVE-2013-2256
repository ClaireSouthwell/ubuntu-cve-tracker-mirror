Description:
 Any tenant is able to show and boot any other tenant's private flavors by
 guessing a flavor ID. This not only exposes the flavor's name, memory and disk
 size, swap allocation, VCPU count and similar flavor properties, but
 potentially allows circumvention of any resource limits enforced through the
 os-flavor-access:is_public property.
