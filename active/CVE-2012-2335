Description: 
 The fix for CVE-2012-1823/CVE-2012-2311 did not address the problem
 for use cases where "unsafe" wrapper script, similar to the one
 pointed out in De Eindbazen's blog, is used.  It seems that was first
 mentioned in Christopher Kunz's (php-security.net) blog mentioning
 that the PHP re-fix is still incomplete, though it's questionable
 if this is to be considered a PHP flaw.
