Description: 
 The issues we recently reported in xpdf/poppler (CVE-2009-0166,  
 CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147) also affect the pdftops filter in CUPS 1.3.9 
 and prior.  CUPS 1.3.9 is not affected by CVE-2009-0165.
 CUPS 1.3.10 addresses this issue by removing the CUPS pdftops filter and 
 replacing it with a wrapper program which executes the system-installed 
 pdftops from Xpdf, poppler, or Ghostscript.  These issues do not affect 
 CUPS on Mac OS X, which uses the cgpdftops filter.

 mdeslaur> our cups uses the system pdftops, so we're not affected
