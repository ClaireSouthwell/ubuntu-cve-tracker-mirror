Description:
 In Apache 2.4, SSLCARevocationCheck directive was added to mod_ssl,
 which defaults it to none and must be explicitly configured. This
 setting enables checking of a certificate revocation list. The default
 Puppet master vhost config shipped with Puppet does not include this
 setting. If a Puppet master is set up to run with Apache 2.4, and this
 default vhost configuration file is used, the Puppet master will
 continue to honor a host's certificate even after it is revoked.
