Description:
 A vulnerability was found in moodle before versions 3.6.3, 3.5.5, 3.4.8 and
 3.1.17. Links within assignment submission comments would open directly (in
 the same window). Although links themselves may be valid, opening within
 the same window and without the no-referrer header policy made them more
 susceptible to exploits.
