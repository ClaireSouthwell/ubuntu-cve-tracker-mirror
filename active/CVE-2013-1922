Description: 
 A security flaw was found in the way qemu-nbd, the QEMU Disk Network
 Block Device server tool of QEMU, performed detection of image formats
 (the image format has been previously autodetected). A guest operating
 system administrator could write a header to particular raw disk image
 format, describing another format than original one for that disk image,
 leading to scenario in which after restart of that guest, QEMU would
 detect new format of the image, and could allow the guest to read any
 file on the host if QEMU was sufficiently privileged.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes:
 jdstrand> attack is: privileged attacker in the guest that uses a raw image
  writes data to beginning of device. Later, someone on the host uses qemu-nbd
  on the attacker-modified image. When the guest is rebooted, the attacker may
  have access to other files.
 jdstrand> On Ubuntu, the preferred virtualization management technology is
  libvirt. As of USN-1008-1, libvirt does not probe the disk format, which
  reduces this attack to a denial of server for the guest (ie, the
  attacker-modified image is not usable on reboot).
 jdstrand> TODO: review use in nova
 mdeslaur> patch just introduced new --format option. Default behaviour is
 mdeslaur> still to autodetect. Adding this new option doesn't fix the
 mdeslaur> issue by itself, so marking as "low"
