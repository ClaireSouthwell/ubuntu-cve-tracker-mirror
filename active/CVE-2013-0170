Description: 
 A flaw was found in the way libvirtd handled connection cleanup (when a
 connection was being closed) under certain error conditions. A remote
 attacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use
 this flaw to crash libvirtd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
 the privileges of the root user.
