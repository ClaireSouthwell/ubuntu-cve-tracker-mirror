Description:
 It was discovered that libxml2, a library providing support to read,
 modify and write XML files, incorrectly performs entity substituton in
 the doctype prolog, even if the application using libxml2 disabled any
 entity substitution. A remote attacker could provide a
 specially-crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead to the
 exhaustion of CPU and memory resources or file descriptors.
