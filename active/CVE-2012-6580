Description:
 Best Practical Solutions RT 3.8.x before 3.8.15 and 4.0.x before 4.0.8,
 when GnuPG is enabled, does not ensure that the UI labels unencrypted
 messages as unencrypted, which might make it easier for remote attackers to
 spoof details of a message's origin or interfere with encryption-policy
 auditing via an e-mail message to a queue's address.
