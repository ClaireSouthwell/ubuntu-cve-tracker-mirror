Description:
 Multiple interpretation error in unspecified versions of ClamAV Antivirus
 allows remote attackers to bypass virus detection via a malicious
 executable in a specially crafted RAR file with malformed central and local
 headers, which can still be opened by products such as Winrar and PowerZip,
 even though they are rejected as corrupted by Winzip and BitZipper.
