Description:
 If a user of Commons-Email (typically an application programmer) passes
 unvalidated input as the so-called "Bounce Address", and that input
 contains line-breaks, then the email details (recipients, contents, etc.)
 might be manipulated. Mitigation: Users should upgrade to Commons-Email
 1.5. You can mitigate this vulnerability for older versions of Commons
 Email by stripping line-breaks from data, that will be passed to
 Email.setBounceAddress(String).
