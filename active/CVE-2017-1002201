Description:
 In haml versions prior to version 5.0.0.beta.2, when using user input to
 perform tasks on the server, characters like < > " ' must be escaped
 properly. In this case, the ' character was missed. An attacker can
 manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes, potentially
 executing code.
