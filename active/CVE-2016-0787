Description:
 It was found that during the SSHv2 handshake when libssh2 is to get
 a suitable value for 'group order' in the Diffle Hellman negotiation,
 it would pass in number of bytes to a function that expected number of
 bits. This would result in the library generating numbers using only an
 8th the number of random bits than what were intended: 128 or 256 bits
 instead of 1023 or 2047. Using such drastically reduced amount of random
 bits for Diffie Hellman weakended the handshake security significantly.
