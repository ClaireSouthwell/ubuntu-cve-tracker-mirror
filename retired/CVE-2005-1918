Description:
 The original patch for a GNU tar directory traversal vulnerability
 (CVE-2002-0399) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 2.1 uses an "incorrect
 optimization" that allows user-assisted attackers to overwrite arbitrary
 files via a crafted tar file, probably involving "/../" sequences with a
 leading "/".
