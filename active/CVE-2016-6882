Description:
 It is possible for RSA private key information to leak if a DHE_RSA based
 cipher suite is supported on the server side. This is the only handshake
 combination in which an RSA signature is sent over the wire (during the
 SERVER_KEY_EXCHANGE message). The signature itself must have been
 incorrectly generated for the exploit to be possible.
