Description:
 The parameter addto is reflected only slightly filtered back to the
 user as part of the HTML page. Some characters are forbidden in the
 GET parameter due to filtering of the URL, but this can be circumvented
 by using a POST parameter. Nevertheless, this issue is exploitable via
 the GET parameter alone, with some user interaction.
