Description:
 PostgreSQL includes a replacement implementation of printf and related
 functions. This code will overrun a stack buffer when formatting a
 floating point number (conversion specifiers e, E, f, F, g or G) with
 requested precision greater than about 500. This will crash the server,
 and we have not ruled out the possibility of attacks that lead to
 privilege escalation. A database user can trigger such a buffer overrun
 through the to_char() SQL function. While that is the only affected
 core PostgreSQL functionality, extension modules that use printf-family
 functions may be at risk as well.
 .
 This issue primarily affects PostgreSQL on Windows. PostgreSQL uses the
 system implementation of these functions where adequate, which it is on
 other modern platforms.
