Description:
 The run_coprocess function in pam_xauth.c in the pam_xauth module in
 Linux-PAM (aka pam) before 1.1.2 does not check the return values of the
 setuid, setgid, and setgroups system calls, which might allow local users
 to read arbitrary files by executing a program that relies on the pam_xauth
 PAM check.
