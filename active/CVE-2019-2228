Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 amurray| The upstream Android patch for this updates their internal copy of
  libcups to 2.2.9 so I am assuming this is a vulnerability in cups and
  hence relevant to Ubuntu
 mdeslaur> array.c isn't being changed in google's update from 2.2.6 to
 mdeslaur> 2.2.9, and I can't see anything relevant to this issue in the
 mdeslaur> cups git tree...marking as deferred for now until Google
 mdeslaur> gives more details.
