Description:
 The hash_buffer function in schnorr.c in OpenSSH through 6.4, when
 Makefile.inc is modified to enable the J-PAKE protocol, does not initialize
 certain data structures, which might allow remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption) or have unspecified other impact via
 vectors that trigger an error condition.
