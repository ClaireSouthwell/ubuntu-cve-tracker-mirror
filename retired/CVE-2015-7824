Description:
 A padding oracle attack was possible against TLS CBC ciphersuites because
 if a certain length check on the packet fields failed, a different
 alert type than one used for message authentication failure would be
 returned to the sender. This check triggering would leak information
 about the value of the padding bytes and could be used to perform
 iterative decryption.
