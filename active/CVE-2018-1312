Description:
 In Apache httpd 2.2.0 to 2.4.29, when generating an HTTP Digest
 authentication challenge, the nonce sent to prevent reply attacks was not
 correctly generated using a pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers
 using a common Digest authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be
 replayed across servers by an attacker without detection.
