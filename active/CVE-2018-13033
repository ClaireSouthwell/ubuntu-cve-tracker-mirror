Description:
 The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
 GNU Binutils 2.30, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (excessive memory allocation and application crash) via a crafted ELF file,
 as demonstrated by _bfd_elf_parse_attributes in elf-attrs.c and bfd_malloc
 in libbfd.c. This can occur during execution of nm.
