Description:
 The admin interface in eZ publish 3.5 before 3.5.7, 3.6 before 3.6.5, 3.7
 before 3.7.3, and 3.8 before 20051110 does not properly handle
 authorization errors, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information and see the admin pagelayout and associated templates via a
 request with (1) "anything after the url" or (2) a "wrong url".
