Candidate: CVE-2006-1269
References:
Description:
 Buffer overflow in the parse function in parse.c in zoo 2.10 might allow
 local users to execute arbitrary code via long filename command line
 arguments, which are not properly handled during archive creation.  NOTE:
 since this issue is local and not setuid, the set of attack scenarios is
 limited, although is reasonable to expect that there are some situations in
 which the zoo user might automatically list attacker-controlled filenames
 to add to the zoo archive.
