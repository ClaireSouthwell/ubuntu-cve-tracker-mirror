Description:
 The AirPDcapPacketProcess function in epan/crypt/airpdcap.c in the 802.11
 dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not
 validate the relationship between the total length and the capture length,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based
 buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted packet.
