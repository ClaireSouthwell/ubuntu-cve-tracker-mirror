Description: 
 It was found that virtio subsystem in qemu-kvm did not properly validate
 virtqueue in and out requests from the guest. A privileged guest user could use
 this flaw to cause buffer overflow, causing the guest to crash (denial of
 service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating their
 privileges on the host.
