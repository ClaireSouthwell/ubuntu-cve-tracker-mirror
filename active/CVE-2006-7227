Candidate: CVE-2006-7227
References:
Description:
 Integer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library
 before 6.7 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 a regular expression containing a large number of named subpatterns
 (name_count) or long subpattern names (max_name_size), which triggers a
 buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by
 CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.
