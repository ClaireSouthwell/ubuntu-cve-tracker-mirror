Description: 
 Telnet utility (used for network devices) writes to insecure location
 The telnet.rb file opens a NET::Telnet connection with an output log of
 /tmp/out.log. That log could be replaced by a symlink anywhere on the system
 and the puppet user would happily write through the symlink, potentially
 clobbering data or worse.
