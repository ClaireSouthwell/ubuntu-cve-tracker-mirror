Description:
 The asn1_d2i_read_bio function in OpenSSL before 0.9.8v, 1.0.0 before
 1.0.0i, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1a does not properly interpret integer data,
 which allows remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks, and cause
 a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact, via crafted DER data, as demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an
 RSA public key.
