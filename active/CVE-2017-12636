Description:
 CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via HTTP(S).
 Some of the configuration options include paths for operating system-level
 binaries that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This allows an admin
 user in Apache CouchDB before 1.7.0 and 2.x before 2.1.1 to execute
 arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user, including downloading and
 executing scripts from the public internet.
