Description:
 SPIP 3.1.x before 3.1.6 and 3.2.x before Beta 3 does not remove shell
 metacharacters from the host field, allowing a remote attacker to cause
 remote code execution.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> The patches look like this is a simple black-list functionality
  but doesn't black-list $() or `` or <() or any other number of shell
  metacharacters. I expect this is still broken and should use a whitelist
  of a-z0-9_-.
