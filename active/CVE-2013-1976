Description:
 A flaw was found in the way the tomcat6 init script handled the
 tomcat6-initd.log log file. A malicious web application deployed on Tomcat
 could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to change the
 ownership of an arbitrary system file to that of the tomcat user, allowing
 them to escalate their privileges to root.
