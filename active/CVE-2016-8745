Description:
 A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP
 connector in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8, 8.0.0.RC1
 to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 and 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 resulted in the current
 Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times. This in
 turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests.
 Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests
 including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug
 was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the
 Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was
 observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced
 the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all
 currently supported Tomcat versions.
