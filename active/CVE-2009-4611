Description:
 Mort Bay Jetty 6.x and 7.0.0 writes backtrace data without sanitizing
 non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to modify a
 window's title, or possibly execute arbitrary commands or overwrite files,
 via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator,
 related to (1) a string value in the Age parameter to the default URI for
 the Cookie Dump Servlet in
 test-jetty-webapp/src/main/java/com/acme/CookieDump.java under cookie/, (2)
 an alphabetic value in the A parameter to jsp/expr.jsp, or (3) an
 alphabetic value in the Content-Length HTTP header to an arbitrary
 application.
