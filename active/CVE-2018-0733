Description: 
 Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO_memcmp function is
 effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte.
 This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as
 authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security
 claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so
 that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected.
