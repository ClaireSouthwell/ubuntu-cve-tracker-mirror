Description:
 system-tools-backends before 2.6.0-1ubuntu1.1 in Ubuntu 8.10, as used by
 "Users and Groups" in GNOME System Tools, hashes account passwords with
 3DES and consequently limits effective password lengths to eight
 characters, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to
 successfully conduct brute-force password attacks.
