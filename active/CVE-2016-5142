Description:
 The Web Cryptography API (aka WebCrypto) implementation in Blink, as used
 in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.116, does not properly copy data buffers,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code,
 related to NormalizeAlgorithm.cpp and SubtleCrypto.cpp.
