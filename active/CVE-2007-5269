Candidate: CVE-2007-5269
References:
Description:
 Certain chunk handlers in libpng before 1.0.29 and 1.2.x before 1.2.21
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted (1)
 pCAL (png_handle_pCAL), (2) sCAL (png_handle_sCAL), (3) tEXt
 (png_push_read_tEXt), (4) iTXt (png_handle_iTXt), and (5) ztXT
 (png_handle_ztXt) chunking in PNG images, which trigger out-of-bounds read
 operations.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> assigned medium because of wide install base
 jdstrand> looking at diff between 1.2.20 and 1.2.21, it appears that Ubuntu
   is affected, though Debian thinks not.  After weeding out the changes,
   there are 9 chunks over pngpread.c and pngrutil.c that appear to be for
   this CVE (the original patch improperly used png_strncpy, where our versions
   have png_strcpy).  TODO: get a reproducer and/or verify png_strcpy is really
   not vulnerable.
