Description:
 Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Special:Upload. Modern
 browsers (since at least as early as December 2010) are able to post file
 uploads without user interaction, violating previous security assumptions
 within MediaWiki.
 
 Depending on the wiki's configuration, this vulnerability could lead to
 further compromise, especially on private wikis where the set of allowed file
 types is broader than on public wikis. Note that CSRF allows compromise of a
 wiki from an external website even if the wiki is behind a firewall.
