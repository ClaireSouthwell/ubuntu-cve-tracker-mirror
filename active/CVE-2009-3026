Description:
 protocols/jabber/auth.c in libpurple in Pidgin 2.6.0, and possibly other
 versions, does not follow the "require TLS/SSL" preference when connecting
 to older Jabber servers that do not follow the XMPP specification, which
 causes libpurple to connect to the server without the expected encryption
 and allows remote attackers to sniff sessions.
