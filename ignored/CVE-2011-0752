Description:
 The extract function in PHP before 5.2.15 does not prevent use of the
 EXTR_OVERWRITE parameter to overwrite (1) the GLOBALS superglobal array and
 (2) the this variable, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass
 intended access restrictions by modifying data structures that were not
 intended to depend on external input, a related issue to CVE-2005-2691 and
 CVE-2006-3758.
