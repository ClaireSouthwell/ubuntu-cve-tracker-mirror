 ipmievd (aka the IPMI event daemon) in OpenIPMI, as used in the ipmitool
 package 1.8.11 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6, Debian GNU/Linux,
 Fedora 16, and other products uses 0666 permissions for its ipmievd.pid PID
 file, which allows local users to kill arbitrary processes by writing to
 this file.
