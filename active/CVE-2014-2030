Description:
 A new ID of CVE-2014-2030 is now assigned for the vulnerability in
 newer ImageMagick versions that use the "L%06ld" string. The root
 cause here is that the code did not recognize the relationship between
 the 8 (or more) characters in "L%06ld" and the actual buffer size.
 This has a resultant buffer overflow of "4 or more bytes too many."
