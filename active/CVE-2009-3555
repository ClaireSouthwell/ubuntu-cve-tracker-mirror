Description: 
 Transport Layer Security (TLS, RFC 5246 and previous, including SSL v3 and
 previous) is subject to a number of serious man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
 related to renegotiation. In general, these problems allow an MITM to inject an
 arbitrary amount of chosen plaintext into the beginning of the application
 protocol stream, leading to a variety of abuse possibilities. In particular,
 practical attacks against HTTPS client certificate authentication have been
 demonstrated against recent versions of both Microsoft IIS and Apache httpd on
 a variety of platforms and in conjunction with a variety of client
 applications. Cases not involving client certificates have been demonstrated as
 well. Although this research has focused on the implications specifically for
 HTTP as the application protocol, the research is ongoing and many of these
 attacks are expected to generalize well to other protocols layered on TLS.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> Fixing this issue requires coordination between the IETF, SSL
  libraries (eg OpenSSL and GnuTLS) and TLS consumers (notably HTTPS servers,
  but most (or all) servers using TLS which support client-initiated
  renegotiation). Protocol-breaking changes are among the possibilities being
  discussed.

  The following is based on http://extendedsubset.com/Renegotiating_TLS.pdf
  and http://extendedsubset.com/Renegotiating_TLS_pd.pdf. You are encouraged to
  read this document as well as the email thread on ietf-tls for complete
  information and most up-to-date status (see References).

  There are essentially 3 types of renegotiation scenarios known at this time
  to be vulnerable, and they all require a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack:
   1. Client certificate authentication: servers configured to require client
      certificate authentication on a per-directory basis. Apache is known
      to be vulnerable when using this configuration. There is no generally
      usable mitigation strategy known at this time.
   2. Differing server cryptographic requirements: servers configured to
      support different cipher suites (the default in Ubuntu). One mitigation
      strategy is to require all content on a site to use a single cipher
      suite. Disallowing specification of TLS parameters in .htaccess files
      (generally modifiable by end users) may also be a good idea.
   3. Client-initiated renegotiation: servers configured for TLS. Apache is
      known to be vulnerable when using using TLS and the client initiates a
      renegotiation. There is no generally usable mitigation strategy known at
      this time.

  The flaw should not allow the attacker to see the contents of the connection,
  and a client cannot be redirected to another site. For the HTTPS scenarios
  listed above, the attacker is able to perform arbitrary GET requests with
  the credentials of the victim. Arbitrary POST requests may also be possible.

  Analysis on the effects of this flaw for other protocols is ongoing.

  Until a general fix can be found for Ubuntu, users may be interested in
  reading http://www.links.org/?p=780, which has a patch to OpenSSL to disable
  all renegotiation.
 jdstrand> Working on update to disable client initiated renegotiations for
  Apache. This won't fix per-directory configurations.
