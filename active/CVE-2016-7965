Description:
 DokuWiki 2016-06-26a and older uses $_SERVER[HTTP_HOST] instead of the
 baseurl setting as part of the password-reset URL. This can lead to
 phishing attacks. (A remote unauthenticated attacker can change the URL's
 hostname via the HTTP Host header.) The vulnerability can be triggered only
 if the Host header is not part of the web server routing process (e.g., if
 several domains are served by the same web server).
