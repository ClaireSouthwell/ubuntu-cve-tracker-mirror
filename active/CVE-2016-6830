Description:
 The "process-execute" and "process-spawn" procedures in CHICKEN Scheme used
 fixed-size buffers for holding the arguments and environment variables to
 use in its execve() call. This would allow user-supplied
 argument/environment variable lists to trigger a buffer overrun. This
 affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and including 4.11 (it will be fixed
 in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).
