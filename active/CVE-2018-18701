Description:
 An issue was discovered in cp-demangle.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed
 in GNU Binutils 2.31. There is a stack consumption vulnerability resulting
 from infinite recursion in the functions next_is_type_qual() and
 cplus_demangle_type() in cp-demangle.c. Remote attackers could leverage
 this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via an ELF file, as
 demonstrated by nm.
