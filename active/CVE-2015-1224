Description:
 The VpxVideoDecoder::VpxDecode function in
 media/filters/vpx_video_decoder.cc in the vpxdecoder implementation in
 Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not ensure that alpha-plane
 dimensions are identical to image dimensions, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted VPx video
 data.
