Description:
 When dnsmasq is used in conjunctions with certain configurations of
 libvirtd, network packets from prohibited networks (e.g. packets that
 should not be passed in) may be sent to the dnsmasq application and
 processed. This can result in DNS amplification attacks for example.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> patch sent upstream but not yet sent upstream or in the git
  repository (http://thekelleys.org.uk/gitweb/?p=dnsmasq.git;a=summary)
 mdeslaur> upstream has added a new --bind-dynamic option in 2.63 instead
 mdeslaur> of using the RH patch. libvirt needs to be modified to use
 mdeslaur> --bind-dynamic also.
 mdeslaur> As of 2012-11-06, no fix for libvirt yet.
