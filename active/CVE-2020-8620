Description:
 In versions of BIND that use the libuv network manager (9.16.x is the only
 stable branch affected) an incorrectly specified maximum buffer size allows
 a specially crafted large TCP payload to trigger an assertion failure when
 it is received.  An attacker who can establish a TCP connection with the
 server and send data on that connection can exploit this to trigger the
 assertion failure, causing the server to exit.
