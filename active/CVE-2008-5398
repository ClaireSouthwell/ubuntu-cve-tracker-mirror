Description:
 Tor before 0.2.0.32 does not properly process the
 ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses configuration option in situations where
 an exit relay issues a policy-based refusal of a stream, which allows
 remote exit relays to have an unknown impact by mapping an internal IP
 address to the destination hostname of a refused stream.
