Description:
 OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2013.1.3 and Havana before havana-2 does
 not properly enforce the os-flavor-access:is_public property, which allows
 remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information (flavor
 properties), boot arbitrary flavors, and possibly have other unspecified
 impacts by guessing the flavor id.
