Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle
 Java SE (subcomponent: Networking). Supported versions that are
 affected are Java SE: 6u131, 7u121 and 8u112; Java SE Embedded:
 8u111. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated
 attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java
 SE, Java SE Embedded.  Successful attacks require human interaction
 from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this
 vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of
 Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability
 applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed
 Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
 and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet)
 and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does
 not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and
 run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
