Description: 
 A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to
 connect to a puppet master and perform unauthorized actions. Specifically,
 given a valid certificate and private key, an agent could retrieve
 catalogs from the master that it is not authorized to access or it could
 poison the puppet masterâ€™s caches for any puppet-generated data that
 supports caching such as catalogs, nodes, facts, and resources.
 The extent and severity of this vulnerability varies depending on the
 specific configuration of the master: for example, whether it is using
 storeconfigs or not, which version, whether it has access to the cache or
 not, etc.
