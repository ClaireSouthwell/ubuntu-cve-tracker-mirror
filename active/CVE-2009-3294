Description:
 The popen API function in TSRM/tsrm_win32.c in PHP before 5.2.11, when
 running on certain Windows operating systems, allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted (1) "e" or (2)
 "er" string in the second argument (aka mode), possibly related to the
 _fdopen function in the Microsoft C runtime library.  NOTE: this might not
 cross privilege boundaries except in rare cases in which the mode argument
 is accessible to an attacker outside of an application that uses the popen
 function.
