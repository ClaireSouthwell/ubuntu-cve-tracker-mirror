Description:
 GSocketClient in GNOME GLib through 2.62.4 may occasionally connect
 directly to a target address instead of connecting via a proxy server when
 configured to do so, because the proxy_addr field is mishandled. This bug
 is timing-dependent and may occur only sporadically depending on network
 delays. The greatest security relevance is in use cases where a proxy is
 used to help with privacy/anonymity, even though there is no technical
 barrier to a direct connection. NOTE: versions before 2.60 are unaffected.
