Description:
 Git through 2.14.2 mishandles layers of tree objects, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted
 repository, aka a Git bomb. This can also have an impact of disk
 consumption; however, an affected process typically would not survive its
 attempt to build the data structure in memory before writing to disk.
