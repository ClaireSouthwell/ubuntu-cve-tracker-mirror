Description:
 The upload module in Drupal 5.x before 5.23 and 6.x before 6.18 does not
 properly support case-insensitive filename handling in a database
 configuration, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass the
 intended restrictions on downloading a file by uploading a different file
 with a similar name.
