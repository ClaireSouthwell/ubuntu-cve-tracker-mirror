Description:
 An issue was discovered in GNOME gnome-desktop 3.26, 3.28, and 3.30 prior
 to 3.30.2.2, and 3.32 prior to 3.32.1.1. A compromised thumbnailer may
 escape the bubblewrap sandbox used to confine thumbnailers by using the
 TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the input buffer of the thumbnailer's
 controlling terminal, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox if the
 thumbnailer has a controlling terminal. This is due to improper filtering
 of the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems, similar to CVE-2019-10063.
