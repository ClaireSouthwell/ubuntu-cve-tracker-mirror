Candidate: CVE-2007-5500
References:
Description:
 The wait_task_stopped function in the Linux kernel before 2.6.23.8 checks a
 TASK_TRACED bit instead of an exit_state value, which allows local users to
 cause a denial of service (machine crash) via unspecified vectors.  NOTE:
 some of these details are obtained from third party information.
