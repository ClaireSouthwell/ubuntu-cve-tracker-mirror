Description:
 If multiple applications used the same custom authorization module class
 name, and provided their own implementations of it, the first application
 to be loaded will have its implementation used for all other applications
 using the same custom authorization module class name. A local attacker
 could use this flaw to deploy a malicious application that provides
 implementations of custom authorization modules that permit or deny user
 access according to rules supplied by the attacker.
