Description:
 LuaExpat before 1.2.0 does not properly detect recursion during entity
 expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large
 number of nested entity references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
