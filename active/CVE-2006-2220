Candidate: CVE-2006-2220
References: 
Description:
 phpBB 2.0.20 does not properly verify user-specified input variables used
 as limits to SQL queries, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information via a negative LIMIT specification, as demonstrated by the
 start parameter to memberlist.php, which reveals the SQL query in the
 resulting error message.
