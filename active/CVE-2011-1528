Description: 
 In the KDC LDAP back end in releases krb5-1.8 and later,
 krb5_ldap_lockout_audit() calls assert() with an expression that
 could be false under as-yet unidentified conditions.  A similar
 problem occurs in the KDC Berkeley DB ("db2") back end in
 krb5_db2_lockout_audit() in releases krb5-1.8 through krb5-1.8.4.
 (The db2 back end no longer has this assertion in releases krb5-1.9
 and later, and is therefore not vulnerable.)
