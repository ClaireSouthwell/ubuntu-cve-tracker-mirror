Description:
 An issue was discovered in wifipcap/wifipcap.cpp in TCPFLOW through
 1.5.0-alpha. There is an integer overflow in the function handle_prism
 during caplen processing. If the caplen is less than 144, one can cause an
 integer overflow in the function handle_80211, which will result in an
 out-of-bounds read and may allow access to sensitive memory (or a denial of
 service).
