Description:
 The writeState function in logrotate.c in logrotate 3.7.9 and earlier might
 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (rotation
 outage) via a (1) \n (newline) or (2) \ (backslash) character in a log
 filename, as demonstrated by a filename that is automatically constructed
 on the basis of a hostname or virtual machine name.
