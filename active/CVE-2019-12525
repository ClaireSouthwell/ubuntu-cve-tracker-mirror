Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid 3.3.9 through 3.5.28 and 4.x through 4.7.
 When Squid is configured to use Digest authentication, it parses the header
 Proxy-Authorization. It searches for certain tokens such as domain, uri,
 and qop. Squid checks if this token's value starts with a quote and ends
 with one. If so, it performs a memcpy of its length minus 2. Squid never
 checks whether the value is just a single quote (which would satisfy its
 requirements), leading to a memcpy of its length minus 1.
