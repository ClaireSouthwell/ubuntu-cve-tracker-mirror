Candidate: CVE-2006-1546
References:
Description:
 Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Struts before 1.2.9 allows remote
 attackers to bypass validation via a request with a
 'org.apache.struts.taglib.html.Constants.CANCEL' parameter, which causes
 the action to be canceled but would not be detected from applications that
 do not use the isCancelled check.
