Description:
 The ProcessGpsInfo function of the gpsinfo.c file of jhead 3.00 may allow a
 remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack or unspecified other
 impact via a malicious JPEG file, because there is an integer overflow
 during a check for whether a location exceeds the EXIF data length. This is
 analogous to the CVE-2016-3822 integer overflow in exif.c. This gpsinfo.c
 vulnerability is unrelated to the CVE-2018-16554 gpsinfo.c vulnerability.
