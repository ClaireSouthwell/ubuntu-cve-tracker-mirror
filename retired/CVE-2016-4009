Description:
 Integer overflow in the ImagingResampleHorizontal function in
 libImaging/Resample.c in Pillow before 3.1.1 allows remote attackers to
 have unspecified impact via negative values of the new size, which triggers
 a heap-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> I believe that ImagingStretch() is the name of the function in
  14.04. More research is needed to determine if it is affected.
