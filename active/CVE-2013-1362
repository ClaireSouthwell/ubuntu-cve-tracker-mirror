 processed by bash.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> This is a problem but requires 'dont_blame_nrpe' to be set in
  /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg. This is set to '0' in Ubuntu and there are significant 
  warnings in /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg about the security risks of enabling
  external command arguments.
