Description:
 The PPAPI implementation in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82 does not
 validate the origin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process that
 should have come from the browser process, which allows remote attackers to
 bypass a sandbox protection mechanism via an unexpected message type,
 related to broker_process_dispatcher.cc, ppapi_plugin_process_host.cc,
 ppapi_thread.cc, and render_frame_message_filter.cc.
