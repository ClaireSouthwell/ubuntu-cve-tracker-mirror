Description:
 An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD before 1.3.6. A wrong
 iteration variable, used when checking a client certificate against CRL
 entries (installed by a system administrator), can cause some CRL entries
 to be ignored, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked
 to proceed with a connection to the server.
