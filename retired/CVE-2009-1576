Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in Drupal 5.x before 5.17 and 6.x before 6.11, as
 used in vbDrupal before 5.17.0, allows user-assisted remote attackers to
 obtain sensitive information by tricking victims into visiting the front
 page of the site with a crafted URL and causing form data to be sent to an
 attacker-controlled site, possibly related to multiple / (slash) characters
 that are not properly handled by includes/bootstrap.inc, as demonstrated
 using the search box.  NOTE: this vulnerability can be leveraged to conduct
 cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
