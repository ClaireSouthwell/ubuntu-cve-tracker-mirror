Description:
 The CSRF protection mechanism in Django through 1.2.7 and 1.3.x through
 1.3.1 does not properly handle web-server configurations supporting
 arbitrary HTTP Host headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger
 unauthenticated forged requests via vectors involving a DNS CNAME record
 and a web page containing JavaScript code.
