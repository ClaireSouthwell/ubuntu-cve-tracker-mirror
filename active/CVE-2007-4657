Candidate: CVE-2007-4657
References: 
Description: 
 Multiple integer overflows in PHP 4 before 4.4.8, and PHP 5 before 5.2.4, allow
 remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory contents) or cause a
 denial of service (thread crash) via a large len value to the (1) strspn or (2)
 strcspn function, which triggers an out-of-bounds read. NOTE: this affects
 different product versions than CVE-2007-3996.
