Description:
 Apache Tomcat 6.0.30 through 6.0.33 and 7.x before 7.0.22 does not properly
 perform certain caching and recycling operations involving request objects,
 which allows remote attackers to obtain unintended read access to IP
 address and HTTP header information in opportunistic circumstances by
 reading TCP data.
