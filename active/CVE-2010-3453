Description:
 The WW8ListManager::WW8ListManager function in oowriter in OpenOffice.org
 (OOo) 2.x and 3.x before 3.3 does not properly handle an unspecified number
 of list levels in user-defined list styles in WW8 data in a Microsoft Word
 document, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted .DOC
 file that triggers an out-of-bounds write.
