Description:
 In JBoss AS 7.1.1 or later, property replacements in any descriptor
 ignores java security policies being used. If a user configures a
 security policy, it can be assumed that deployments cannot access
 properties unless a separate policy is specified. A malicious
 application could exploit this flaw to access such properties,
 potentially including properties from the security vault and
 environment variables.
