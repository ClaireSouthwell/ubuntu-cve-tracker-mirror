Description:
 The swf_DefineLosslessBitsTagToImage function in lib/modules/swfbits.c in
 SWFTools 0.9.2 mishandles an uncompress failure, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
 application crash) because of extractDefinitions in lib/readers/swf.c and
 fill_line_bitmap in lib/devices/render.c, as demonstrated by swfrender.
