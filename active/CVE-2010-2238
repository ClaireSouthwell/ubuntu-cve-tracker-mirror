Description:
 Red Hat libvirt, possibly 0.7.2 through 0.8.2, recurses into disk-image
 backing stores without extracting the defined disk backing-store format,
 which might allow guest OS users to read arbitrary files on the host OS,
 and possibly have unspecified other impact, via unknown vectors.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes: 
 jdstrand> upstream did not get the AppArmor bits quite right, so 0.8.2 may
  need additional patches
 jdstrand> AppArmor in Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 should protect the host OS, but
  an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another
  machine.
 jdstrand> upstream patch is highly intrusive, needs rewriting for all affected   releases, requires a conffile change and potentially a migration helper.
