Description:
 The zend_string_extend function in Zend/zend_string.h in PHP through 7.1.5
 does not prevent changes to string objects that result in a negative
 length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging
 a script's use of .= with a long string.
