Description:
 The privilege-dropping implementation in the (1) pam_env and (2) pam_mail
 modules in Linux-PAM (aka pam) 1.1.2 does not perform the required setfsgid
 and setgroups system calls, which might allow local users to obtain
 sensitive information by leveraging unintended group permissions, as
 demonstrated by a symlink attack on the .pam_environment file in a user's
 home directory.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete
 fix for CVE-2010-3435.
