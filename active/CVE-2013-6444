Description:
  PyWBEM, a Python library for making CIM (Common Information Model) operations
 over HTTP using the WBEM CIM-XML protocol, failed to verify the URI matches
 the Subject of the certificate. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
 to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain
 name.
