Description: 
 OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error state"
 mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then
 OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you
 attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit
 handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()),
 however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is
 called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error
 will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is
 subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will
 succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from
 the SSL/TLS record layer.
