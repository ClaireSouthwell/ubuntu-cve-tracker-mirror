Description: 
 The client can send continual pings to an HTTP/2 server, causing the server
 to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this
 data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially
 leading to a Denial-of-Service. Also known as "HTTP/2 Ping Flood".
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sbeattie> nginx added http2 support in 1.9.5
 sbeattie> nginx previously fixed issue for CVE-2018-16844
 sbeattie> netty added http2 support in 4.1.0
 sbeattie> nghttp2: nghttpd and nghttp are affected, libnghttp2 is not
 sbeattie> twisted added http2 support in 16.3
 sbeattie> trafficserver enabled http2 support by default in 7.0
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
