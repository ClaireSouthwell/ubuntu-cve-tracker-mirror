Description:
 The LZW decompressor in the LWZReadByte function in giftoppm.c in the David
 Koblas GIF decoder in PBMPLUS, as used in the gif_read_lzw function in
 filter/image-gif.c in CUPS before 1.4.7, the LZWReadByte function in
 plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c in GIMP 2.6.11 and earlier, the LZWReadByte
 function in img/gifread.c in XPCE in SWI-Prolog 5.10.4 and earlier, and
 other products, does not properly handle code words that are absent from
 the decompression table when encountered, which allows remote attackers to
 trigger an infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly
 execute arbitrary code, via a crafted compressed stream, a related issue to
 CVE-2006-1168 and CVE-2011-2895.
