Description:
 The Image11::map function in renderer/d3d/d3d11/Image11.cpp in libANGLE, as
 used in Google Chrome before 46.0.2490.71, mishandles mapping failures
 after device-lost events, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (invalid read or write) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via vectors involving a removed device.
