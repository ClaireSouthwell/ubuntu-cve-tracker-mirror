Description:
 In addition munin parses parts of the query string. You are
 allowed to modify the size of the image. By choosing a path 
 "....png?size_x=20000&size_y=20000&uniquestuff" you can do the 
 same attack while simultaneously using a large image size. The
 raw image would be 381M (assuming 8bits/pixel) in this case. A
 png version will likely be smaller, say 4M? So now you have an 
 amplification of 4M/request. Note that this query can get a
 node into swapping, because rrdtool needs to create the whole
 image in main memory.
