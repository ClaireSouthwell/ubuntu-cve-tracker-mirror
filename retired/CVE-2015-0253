Description:
 The read_request_line function in server/protocol.c in the Apache HTTP
 Server 2.4.12 does not initialize the protocol structure member, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
 dereference and process crash) by sending a request that lacks a method to
 an installation that enables the INCLUDES filter and has an ErrorDocument
 400 directive specifying a local URI.
