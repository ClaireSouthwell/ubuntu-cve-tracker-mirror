Description:
 shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux,
 and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid
 programs are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when
 compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing
 --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable
 for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to
 account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel,
 usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate
 privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant
 in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the
 chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now
 included in the release version 4.8).
