Description: 
 When using the default Unix-socket-based transport, dbus-daemon accepts
 and forwards file descriptors (fds) attached to D-Bus messages
 ("fd-passing"). If the max_message_unix_fds limit is set to an odd
 number on 64-bit platforms, a malicious message-sender could pass one
 more fd through the kernel than the recipient is expecting. This causes
 an assertion failure and dbus-daemon crash if assertions are enabled, or
 a buffer overrun by sizeof (int) otherwise.
