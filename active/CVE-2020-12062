Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The scp client in OpenSSH 8.2 incorrectly sends duplicate
 responses to the server upon a utimes system call failure, which allows a
 malicious unprivileged user on the remote server to overwrite arbitrary
 files in the client's download directory by creating a crafted subdirectory
 anywhere on the remote server. The victim must use the command scp -rp to
 download a file hierarchy containing, anywhere inside, this crafted
 subdirectory. NOTE: the vendor points out that "this attack can achieve no
 more than a hostile peer is already able to achieve within the scp
 protocol" and "utimes does not fail under normal circumstances."
