Description:
 Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, enables a quirks-mode
 exception that limits the cases in which a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
 document is required to have the text/css content type, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site, related
 to core/fetch/CSSStyleSheetResource.cpp.
