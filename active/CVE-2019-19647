 https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/issues/15545
Description:
 radare2 through 4.0.0 lacks validation of the content variable in the
 function r_asm_pseudo_incbin at libr/asm/asm.c, ultimately leading to an
 arbitrary write. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted
 input.
