Description: 
 issue in parser via uninitialized here_doc_eof field
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> this issue is mitigated by Florian Weimer's prefix-suffix patch
 mdeslaur> that is included in http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2364-1/
 mdeslaur> since bash parser vulnerabilities are now limited to specially
 mdeslaur> named environment variables, and as such are no longer directly
 mdeslaur> exposed to CGI scripts, SSH, etc.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> As of 2014-09-30, there is no official upstream patch for this
 mdeslaur> vulnerability. Once an upstream patch is made available, we
 mdeslaur> will release bash updates, but we don't consider this to be
 mdeslaur> a critical issue requiring immediate attention.
