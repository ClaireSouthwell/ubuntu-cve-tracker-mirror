Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the CORBA component in Oracle Java SE and Java
 for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update and 25 allows remote attackers to
 affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
Ubuntu-Description:
  It was discovered that the privileged accept method of the
  ServerSocket class in the CORBA implementation allowed it to receive
  connections from any host, instead of just the host of the current
  connection.  An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions
  defined by network permissions.
