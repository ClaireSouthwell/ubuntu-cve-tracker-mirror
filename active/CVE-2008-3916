Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the strip_escapes function in signal.c in GNU
 ed before 1.0 allows context-dependent or user-assisted attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: since ed itself does not
 typically run with special privileges, this issue only crosses privilege
 boundaries when ed is invoked as a third-party component.
