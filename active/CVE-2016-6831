Description:
 The "process-execute" and "process-spawn" procedures did not free memory
 correctly when the execve() call failed, resulting in a memory leak. This
 could be abused by an attacker to cause resource exhaustion or a denial of
 service. This affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and including 4.11 (it
 will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).
