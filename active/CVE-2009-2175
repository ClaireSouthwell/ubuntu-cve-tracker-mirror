Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the flattenIncrementally function in
 flatten.c in xcftools 1.0.4, as reachable from the (1) xcf2pnm and (2)
 xcf2png utilities, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted image that causes
 a conversion to a location "above or to the left of the canvas." NOTE: some
 of these details are obtained from third party information.
