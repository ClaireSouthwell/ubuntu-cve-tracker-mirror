Description:
 Race condition with changing umask.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> The upstream patch uses umask(0022) instead of umask(0) -- which
  seems as bad as the original behaviour. We should see if there is an updated
  patch when we prepare our packages that replaces the bad code.
 mdeslaur> introduced by the fix for http://bugs.python.org/issue9299
 mdeslaur> upstream commited a better fix than the proposed one in the bug
 mdeslaur> but it now changes behavour
