Description:
 It was found that the fix for CVE-2010-0547, provided in the cifs-utils
 package included in the GA release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, was
 incomplete. The mount.cifs tool did not properly handle share or directory
 names containing a newline character, allowing a local attacker to corrupt
 the mtab (mounted file systems table) file via a specially-crafted CIFS
 share mount request, if mount.cifs had the setuid bit set.
