Description:
 There is a possible XSS vulnerability in all rails-html-sanitizer gem
 versions below 1.0.4 for Ruby. The gem allows non-whitelisted attributes to
 be present in sanitized output when input with specially-crafted HTML
 fragments, and these attributes can lead to an XSS attack on target
 applications. This issue is similar to CVE-2018-8048 in Loofah. All users
 running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
 workarounds immediately.
