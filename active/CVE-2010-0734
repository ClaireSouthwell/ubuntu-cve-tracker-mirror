Description:
 content_encoding.c in libcurl 7.10.5 through 7.19.7, when zlib is enabled,
 does not properly restrict the amount of callback data sent to an
 application that requests automatic decompression, which might allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or have
 unspecified other impact by sending crafted compressed data to an
 application that relies on the intended data-length limit.
