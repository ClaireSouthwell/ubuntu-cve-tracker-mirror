Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x through 2.7.STABLE9, 3.x through
 3.5.28, and 4.x through 4.7. When Squid is configured to use Basic
 Authentication, the Proxy-Authorization header is parsed via uudecode.
 uudecode determines how many bytes will be decoded by iterating over the
 input and checking its table. The length is then used to start decoding the
 string. There are no checks to ensure that the length it calculates isn't
 greater than the input buffer. This leads to adjacent memory being decoded
 as well. An attacker would not be able to retrieve the decoded data unless
 the Squid maintainer had configured the display of usernames on error
 pages.
