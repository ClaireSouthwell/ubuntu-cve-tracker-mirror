Description:
 Prior to 1.6.4, an attacker could possibly determine some content of
 cookie-based sessions encrypted with PyCrypto due to how the data was
 encrypted. This flaw did not affect pycryptopp sessions, nor does it allow an
 attacker to change data as a separate HMAC is used to sign the encrypted
 payload.
