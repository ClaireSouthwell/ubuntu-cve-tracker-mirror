 https://secure.grepular.com/DNS_Prefetch_Exposure_on_Thunderbird_and_Webmail
Description:
 Mozilla Necko, as used in Thunderbird 3.0.1, SeaMonkey, and other
 applications, performs DNS prefetching even when the app type is
 APP_TYPE_MAIL or APP_TYPE_EDITOR, which makes it easier for remote
 attackers to determine the network location of the application's user by
 logging DNS requests, as demonstrated by DNS requests triggered by reading
 text/plain e-mail messages in Thunderbird.
