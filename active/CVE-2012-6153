Description:
 It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-5783 was incomplete. The code
 added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name
 in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a
 Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, where the attacker can spoof a valid
 certificate using a specially crafted subject.
