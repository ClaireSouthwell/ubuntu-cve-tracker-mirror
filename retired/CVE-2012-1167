Description:
 When a JBoss server is configured to use JaccAuthorizationRealm, the
 WebPermissionMapping class creates permissions that are not checked and can
 permit access to users without checking their roles. If the
 ignoreBaseDecision property is set to true on JBossWebRealm, the web
 authorization process is handled exclusively by JBossAuthorizationEngine,
 without any input from JBoss Web. This allows any valid user to access an
 application, without needing to be assigned the role specified in the
 application's web.xml "security-constraint" tag.
