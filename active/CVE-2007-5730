Candidate: CVE-2007-5730
References:
Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in QEMU 0.8.2 allows local users to execute
 arbitrary code via crafted data in the "net socket listen" option, aka QEMU
 "net socket" heap overflow.  NOTE: some sources have used CVE-2007-1321 to
 refer to this issue as part of "NE2000 network driver and the socket code,"
 but this is the correct identifier for the individual net socket listen
 vulnerability.
