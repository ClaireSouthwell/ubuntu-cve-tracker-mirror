Description: 
 It was discovered that libtasn1 library function asn1_get_bit_der() could
 incorrectly report negative bit length of the value read from ASN.1 input.
 This could possibly lead to an out of bounds access in an application
 using libtasn1, for example in case if application tried to terminate read
 value with NUL byte.
