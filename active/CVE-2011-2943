Description:
 The irc_msg_who function in msgs.c in the IRC protocol plugin in libpurple
 2.8.0 through 2.9.0 in Pidgin before 2.10.0 does not properly validate
 characters in nicknames, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash)
 via a crafted nickname that is not properly handled in a WHO response.
