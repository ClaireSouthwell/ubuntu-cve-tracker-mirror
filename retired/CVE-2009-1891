Description:
 A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This
 module continued to compress large files until compression was complete,
 even if the network connection that requested the content was closed before
 compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large
 amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file.
