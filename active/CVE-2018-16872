Description:
 A flaw was found in qemu Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). The code opening
 files in usb_mtp_get_object and usb_mtp_get_partial_object and directories
 in usb_mtp_object_readdir doesn't consider that the underlying filesystem
 may have changed since the time lstat(2) was called in
 usb_mtp_object_alloc, a classical TOCTTOU problem. An attacker with write
 access to the host filesystem shared with a guest can use this property to
 navigate the host filesystem in the context of the QEMU process and read
 any file the QEMU process has access to. Access to the filesystem may be
 local or via a network share protocol such as CIFS.
