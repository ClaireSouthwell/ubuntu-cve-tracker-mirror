Description:
 Description: Cherokee supports authenticating users via LDAP. It does
 not ensure that users provide a non-empty password when doing so. If the
 underlying LDAP server allows unauthenticated binds, an unauthenticated
 bind will be performed and not the name/password-based authenticated bind
 that Cherokee is expecting. This success of this bind will cause Cherokee
 to authenticate the user. This allows an attacker to authenticate as
 a user for which they only know the username and not the password.
