Description:
 An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka
 libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31. An invalid memory address
 dereference was discovered in read_reloc in reloc.c. The vulnerability
 causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of
 service, as demonstrated by objdump, because of missing _bfd_clear_contents
 bounds checking.
