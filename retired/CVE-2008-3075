Description:
 The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows
 user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the "!" (exclamation
 point) shell metacharacter in (1) the filename of a ZIP archive and
 possibly (2) the filename of the first file in a ZIP archive, which is not
 properly handled by zip.vim in the VIM ZIP plugin (zipPlugin.vim) v.11
 through v.21, as demonstrated by the zipplugin and zipplugin.v2 test cases.
  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2008-2712.  NOTE: this issue has the same root cause as CVE-2008-3074.
 NOTE: due to the complexity of the associated disclosures and the
 incomplete information related to them, there may be inaccuracies in this
 CVE description and in external mappings to this identifier.
