Description:
 In Heimdal through 7.4, remote unauthenticated attackers are able to crash
 the KDC by sending a crafted UDP packet containing empty data fields for
 client name or realm. The parser would unconditionally dereference NULL
 pointers in that case, leading to a segmentation fault. This is related to
 the _kdc_as_rep function in kdc/kerberos5.c and the
 der_length_visible_string function in lib/asn1/der_length.c.
