Description:
 authz.c in the mod_dav_svn module for the Apache HTTP Server, as
 distributed in Apache Subversion 1.5.x before 1.5.8 and 1.6.x before
 1.6.13, when SVNPathAuthz short_circuit is enabled, does not properly
 handle a named repository as a rule scope, which allows remote
 authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via svn
 commands.
