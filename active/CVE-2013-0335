Description:
 VNC proxy can connect to the wrong VM
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> on 11.10, VNC consoles are only available via the web interface,
  but the web interface (horizon) is not functional since it depends on
  keystone and the keystone in 11.10 is a pre-release version and unusable with
  other components like horizon and nova.
