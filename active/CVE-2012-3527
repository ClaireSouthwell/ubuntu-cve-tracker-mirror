Description:
 Due to a missing signature (HMAC) for a parameter in
 the view_help.php file, an attacker could unserialize arbitrary
 objects within TYPO3. We are aware of a working exploit, which can
 lead to arbitrary code execution. A valid backend user login or
 multiple successful cross site request forgery attacks are required
 to exploit this vulnerability.
