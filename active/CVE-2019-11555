Description:
 The EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) before 2.8 and
 wpa_supplicant (EAP peer) before 2.8 does not validate fragmentation
 reassembly state properly for a case where an unexpected fragment could be
 received. This could result in process termination due to a NULL pointer
 dereference (denial of service). This affects eap_server/eap_server_pwd.c
 and eap_peer/eap_pwd.c.
