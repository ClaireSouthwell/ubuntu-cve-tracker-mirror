Description:
 In SWFTools 0.9.2, the png_load function in lib/png.c does not properly
 validate an alloclen_64 multiplication of width and height values, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow,
 heap-based buffer overflow, and application crash) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted PNG file.
