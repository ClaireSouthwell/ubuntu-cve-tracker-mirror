Description:
 PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through 5.2.1 allows context-dependent
 attackers to read arbitrary memory locations via an interruption that
 triggers a user space error handler that changes a parameter to an
 arbitrary pointer, as demonstrated via the iptcembed function, which calls
 certain convert_to_* functions with its input parameters.
