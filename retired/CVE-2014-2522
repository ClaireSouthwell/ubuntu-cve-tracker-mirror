Description:
 curl and libcurl 7.27.0 through 7.35.0, when running on Windows and using
 the SChannel/Winssl TLS backend, does not verify that the server hostname
 matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName
 field of the X.509 certificate when accessing a URL that uses a numerical
 IP address, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via
 an arbitrary valid certificate.
