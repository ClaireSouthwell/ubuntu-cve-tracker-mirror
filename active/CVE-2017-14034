Description:
 The restore_tqb_pixels function in hevc_filter.c in libavcodec, as used in
 libbpg 0.9.7 and other products, miscalculates a memcpy destination
 address, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact.
