Description:
 Google Chrome executes DOM calls in response to a javascript: URI in the
 target attribute of a submit element within a form contained in an inline
 PDF file, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended Adobe
 Acrobat JavaScript restrictions on accessing the document object, as
 demonstrated by a web site that permits PDF uploads by untrusted users, and
 therefore has a shared document.domain between the web site and this
 javascript: URI.  NOTE: the researcher reports that Adobe's position is "a
 PDF file is active content."
