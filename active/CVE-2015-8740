Description:
 The dissect_tds7_colmetadata_token function in epan/dissectors/packet-tds.c
 in the TDS dissector in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate the
 number of columns, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted
 packet.
