Description:
 ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an invalid
 wddxPacket XML document that is mishandled in a wddx_deserialize call, as
 demonstrated by a stray element inside a boolean element, leading to
 incorrect pop processing.
