Description:
 The Microsoft CHM file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 and Sophos Anti-Virus 4.61.0
 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a crafted reset
 interval in the LZXC header of a CHM file.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT
 into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the
 error occurred independently in different CHM parser implementations.
