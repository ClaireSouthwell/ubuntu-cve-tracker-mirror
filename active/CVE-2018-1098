Description:
 A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier. An
 attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd
 server and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is
 theoretically safe (can't PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows
 creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.
