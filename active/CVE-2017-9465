Description:
 The yr_arena_write_data function in YARA 3.6.1 allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) or
 obtain sensitive information from process memory via a crafted file that is
 mishandled in the yr_re_fast_exec function in libyara/re.c and the
 _yr_scan_match_callback function in libyara/scan.c.
