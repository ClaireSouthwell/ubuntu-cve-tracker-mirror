# This script attempts to build up statistics for a monthly report on
# security update activity on USNs, triage, and outstanding tasks.
# It is designed to be run on the month _following_ the month one wants
# a report for.  e.g. run this script in April if you want the March report.
#
# By default, report in a more prose-style.  E.g.:
#  The security team had a busy month.  We published 29 Ubuntu Security
#  Notices which fixed 63 security issues (CVEs) across 30 supported
#  packages.  Additionally, we triaged 487 public security vulnerability
#  reports, weeding out only those that applied to Ubuntu.
#
#  For all the supported packages in Ubuntu, there are 67 medium-priority
#  issues and 206 low issues that need to be fixed in 142 packages.
#
#  For all partner packages in Ubuntu, there is 1 medium-priority issue
#  that needs to be fixed in 1 package.
#
#  For all community-supported packages in Ubuntu, there are 7 high-priority
#  issues, 721 medium-priority, and 1005 low-priority issues that need to be
#  fixed in 686 packages.
