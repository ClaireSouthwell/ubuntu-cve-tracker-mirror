Description:
 Through a malicious URL that contained a quote character it was possible to
 inject HTML code in KMail's plaintext viewer. Due to the parser used on the
 URL it was not possible to include the equal sign (=) or a space into the
 injected HTML, which greatly reduces the available HTML functionality.
 Although it is possible to include an HTML comment indicator to hide
 content.

 mdeslaur> per ScottK: Affected package is kdepimlibs in 12.04 - 15.04 and
