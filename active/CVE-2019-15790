Description:
 Apport contains an information disclosure vulnerability since it reads
 /proc/$PID/ files with elevated privileges during crash dump
 generation. This could allow a local attacker who could cause a PID race
 reuse during Apport crash dump generation to generate a crash report for a
 privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.
