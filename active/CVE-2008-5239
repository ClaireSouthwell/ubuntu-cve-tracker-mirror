Description:
 xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and earlier versions, does not properly
 handle (a) negative and (b) zero values during unspecified read function
 calls in input_file.c, input_net.c, input_smb.c, and input_http.c, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via vectors such as (1) a file or (2) an HTTP
 response, which triggers consequences such as out-of-bounds reads and
 heap-based buffer overflows.
