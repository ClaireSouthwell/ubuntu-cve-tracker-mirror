Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the load_preset_response function in
 plug-ins/lighting/lighting-ui.c in the "LIGHTING EFFECTS > LIGHT" plugin in
 GIMP 2.6.11 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long
 Position field in a plugin configuration file.  NOTE: it may be uncommon to
 obtain a GIMP plugin configuration file from an untrusted source that is
 separate from the distribution of the plugin itself.  NOTE: some of these
 details are obtained from third party information.
