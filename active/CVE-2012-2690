Description:
 It was found that editing files with virt-edit left said files in a
 world-readable state (and did not preserve the file owner or
 Security-Enhanced Linux context). If an administrator on the host used
 virt-edit to edit a file inside a guest, the file would be left with
 world-readable permissions. This could lead to unprivileged guest users
 accessing files they would otherwise be unable to.
