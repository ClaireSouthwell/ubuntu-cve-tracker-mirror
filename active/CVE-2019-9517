Description: 
 This opens the HTTP/2 window so the server can send without constraint;
 however, it leaves the TCP window closed so the server cannot actually
 write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The client could then send a stream
 of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue
 the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially
 leading to a Denial-of-Service.  Also known as "HTTP2 Internal Data
 Buffering / Queue Filler".
