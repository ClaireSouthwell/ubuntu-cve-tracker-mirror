Description:
 Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in the layout implementation in
 Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.117, allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via vectors involving (1) running JavaScript code during execution
 of the updateWidgetPositions function or (2) making a call into a plugin
 during execution of the updateWidgetPositions function.
