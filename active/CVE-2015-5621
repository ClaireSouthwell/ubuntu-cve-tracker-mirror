Description:
 It was discovered that the snmp_pdu_parse() function could leave
 incompletely parsed varBind variables in the list of variables in
 case the parsing of the SNMP PDU failed. If later processing tries to
 operate on the stale and incompletely processed varBind (e.g. when
 printing the variables), this can lead to e.g. crashes or, possibly,
 execution of arbitrary code.
