Description: 
 A missing input sanitation flaw was found in the way gzip used to decompress
 data blocks for dynamic Huffman codes. A remote attacker could provide a
 specially-crafted gzip compressed data archive, which once opened by a local,
 unsuspecting user would lead to denial of service (gzip crash) or,
 potentially,  to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the
 user running gzip.
