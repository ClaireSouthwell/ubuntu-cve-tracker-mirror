Description:
 VNC server implementation in Quick Emulator (QEMU) before 2.14.3 was found
 to be vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue, as it did not
 throttle the framebuffer updates sent to its client. If the client did not
 consume these updates, VNC server allocates growing memory to hold onto
 this data. A malicious remote VNC client could use this flaw to cause DoS
 to the server host.
