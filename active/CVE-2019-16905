Description:
 OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an
 experimental key type, has a pre-authentication integer overflow if a
 client or server is configured to use a crafted XMSS key. This leads to
 memory corruption and remote code execution because of an error in the XMSS
 key parsing algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered
 experimental in all released OpenSSH versions, and there is no supported
 way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
