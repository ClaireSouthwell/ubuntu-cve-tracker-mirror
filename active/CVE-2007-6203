Description:
 Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x and 2.2.x does not sanitize the HTTP Method
 specifier header from an HTTP request when it is reflected back in a "413
 Request Entity Too Large" error message, which might allow cross-site
 scripting (XSS) style attacks using web client components that can send
 arbitrary headers in requests, as demonstrated via an HTTP request
 containing an invalid Content-length value, a similar issue to
 CVE-2006-3918.
