Description:
 The var_export function in PHP 5.2 before 5.2.14 and 5.3 before 5.3.3
 flushes the output buffer to the user when certain fatal errors occur, even
 if display_errors is off, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information by causing the application to exceed limits for memory,
 execution time, or recursion.
