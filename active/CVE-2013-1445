Description:
 The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not
 properly reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a
 child process to access it, which makes it easier for context-dependent
 attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a race condition in
 which a child process is created and accesses the PRNG within the same
 rate-limit period as another process.
