Description: 
 NULL dereference was found in libssh 0.5.3's publickey_from_privatekey()
 function.  When a server using libssh receives a "Client: Key Exchange Init",
 the server sets up the session and tries to set the algorithms by matching
 what the user specified vs what is supported in crypt_set_algorithms_server().
 If there is no match, it will lead to a NULL dereference when receiving the
 "Client: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Init" packet, which will cause the
 program using libssh to crash.
