Description:
 An integer underflow vulnerability exists in pixel-a.asm, the x86 assembly
 code for planeClipAndMax() in MulticoreWare x265 through 2.4, as used by
 the x265_encoder_encode dependency in libbpg and other products. A small
 picture can cause an integer underflow, which leads to a Denial of Service
