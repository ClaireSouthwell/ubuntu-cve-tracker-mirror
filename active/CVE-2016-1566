Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the file browser in Guacamole
 0.9.8 and 0.9.9, when file transfer is enabled to a location shared by
 multiple users, allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web
 script or HTML via a crafted filename.  NOTE: this vulnerability was fixed
 in guacamole.war on 2016-01-13, but the version number was not changed.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> It looks like the guacamole version numbers are useless: there are
  both broken versions 0.9.8 and 0.9.9 and fixed versions 0.9.8 and 0.9.9.
  They apparently make changes and republish with the same version number.
  Thus I'm being conservative and marking everything as affected.
