Description:
 The dissect_pw_eth_heuristic function in epan/dissectors/packet-pw-eth.c in
 Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 does not properly
 handle apparent Ethernet address values at the beginning of MPLS data,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loop) via a
 malformed packet.
