Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the GFIG plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows
 user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Foreground field in a
 plugin configuration file.  NOTE: it may be uncommon to obtain a GIMP
 plugin configuration file from an untrusted source that is separate from
 the distribution of the plugin itself.
