Description:
 Apache Tomcat before 5.5.35, 6.x before 6.0.35, and 7.x before 7.0.23 does
 not properly handle a large number of form parameters, which might allow
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a
 request that triggers storage of many parameters in a hash table.
