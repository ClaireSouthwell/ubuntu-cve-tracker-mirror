Description:
 Integer overflow read_section_from_string may lead to heap based overflow.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Chris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in GRUB2
 when handling certain filesystems or font files, leading to heap-based
 buffer overflows. A local attacker could use these to execute arbitrary
 code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes: 
 amurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)
  and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low
Mitigation:
