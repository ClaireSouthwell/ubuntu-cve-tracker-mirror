Description:
 Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to
 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, provide client-side support for
 multipart requests. When Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux server application
 (server A) receives input from a remote client, and then uses that input to
 make a multipart request to another server (server B), it can be exposed to
 an attack, where an extra multipart is inserted in the content of the
 request from server A, causing server B to use the wrong value for a part
 it expects. This could to lead privilege escalation, for example, if the
 part content represents a username or user roles.
