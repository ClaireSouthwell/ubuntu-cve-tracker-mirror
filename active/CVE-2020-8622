Description:
 Attempting to verify a truncated response to a TSIG-signed request leads to
 an assertion failure.  An attacker on the network path for a TSIG-signed
 request, or operating the server receiving the TSIG-signed request, could
 send a truncated response to that request, triggering an assertion failure,
 causing the server to exit.  Alternately, an off-path attacker would have
 to correctly guess when a TSIG-signed request was sent, along with other
 characteristics of the packet and message, and spoof a truncated response
 to trigger an assertion failure, causing the server to exit.
