Description:
 This bug happens when a SSH server forks on new connections. OpenSSL PRNG
 does not always detect the change of process (PID collision) and PRNG
 state may be shared between two successive children. However that bug is
 greatly mitigated by OpenSSL ECDSA signing code itself that reseeds the
 PRNG on every operation.
