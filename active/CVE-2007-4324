Description:
 ActionScript 3 (AS3) in Adobe Flash Player 9.0.47.0, and other versions
 before 9.0.115.0, allows remote attackers to bypass the Security Sandbox
 Model, obtain sensitive information, and port scan arbitrary hosts via a
 Flash (SWF) movie that specifies a connection to make, then uses timing
 discrepancies from the SecurityErrorEvent error to determine whether a port
 is open or not.
