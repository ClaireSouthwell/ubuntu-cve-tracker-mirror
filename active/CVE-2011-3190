Description:
 Certain AJP protocol connector implementations in Apache Tomcat 7.0.0
 through 7.0.20, 6.0.0 through 6.0.33, 5.5.0 through 5.5.33, and possibly
 other versions allow remote attackers to spoof AJP requests, bypass
 authentication, and obtain sensitive information by causing the connector
 to interpret a request body as a new request.
