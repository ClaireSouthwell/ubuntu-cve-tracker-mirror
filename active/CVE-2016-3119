 https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/08c642c09c38a9c6454ab43a9b53b2a89b9eef99
Description:
 The process_db_args function in
 plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_principal2.c in the LDAP KDB module in
 kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.13.4 and 1.14.x through
 1.14.1 mishandles the DB argument, which allows remote authenticated users
 to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash)
 via a crafted request to modify a principal.
