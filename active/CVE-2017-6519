Description:
 avahi-daemon in Avahi through 0.6.32 inadvertently responds to IPv6 unicast
 queries with source addresses that are not on-link, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) or obtain
 potentially sensitive information via port-5353 UDP packets. NOTE: this may
 overlap CVE-2015-2809.
