Description: 
 Pádraig Brady from Red Hat discovered that the fix implemented for
 CVE-2012-3361 (OSSA-2012-008) was not covering all attack scenarios. By
 crafting a malicious image with root-readable-only symlinks and
 requesting a server based on it, an authenticated user could still
 corrupt arbitrary files (all setups affected) or inject arbitrary files
 (Essex and later setups with OpenStack API enabled and a libvirt-based
 hypervisor) on the host filesystem, potentially resulting in full
 compromise of that compute node.
