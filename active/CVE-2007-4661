Candidate: CVE-2007-4661
References: 
Description: 
 The chunk_split function in string.c in PHP 5.2.3 does not properly calculate
 the needed buffer size due to precision loss when performing integer arithmetic
 with floating point numbers, which has unknown attack vectors and impact,
 possibly resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. NOTE: this is due to an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2007-2872
