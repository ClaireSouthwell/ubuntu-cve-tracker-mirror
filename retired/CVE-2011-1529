Description: 
 In releases krb5-1.8 and later, lookup_lockout_policy() in both the
 Berkeley DB ("db2") and LDAP KDC back ends fails to check that the
 principal entry pointer is non-null prior to dereferencing it.  This
 can happen if an error condition such as KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED or
 KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_BAD_INTEGRITY occurs in process_as_req() before it
 retrieves the principal database entry for the requested client.
