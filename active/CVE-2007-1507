Description:
 The default configuration in OpenAFS 1.4.x before 1.4.4 and 1.5.x before
 1.5.17 supports setuid programs within the local cell, which might allow
 attackers to gain privileges by spoofing a response to an AFS cache manager
 FetchStatus request, and setting setuid and root ownership for files in the
 cache.
