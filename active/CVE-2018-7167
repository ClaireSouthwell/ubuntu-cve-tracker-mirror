Description:
 Calling Buffer.fill() or Buffer.alloc() with some parameters can lead to a
 hang which could result in a Denial of Service. In order to address this
 vulnerability, the implementations of Buffer.alloc() and Buffer.fill() were
 updated so that they zero fill instead of hanging in these cases. All
 versions of Node.js 6.x (LTS "Boron"), 8.x (LTS "Carbon"), and 9.x are
 vulnerable. All versions of Node.js 10.x (Current) are NOT vulnerable.
