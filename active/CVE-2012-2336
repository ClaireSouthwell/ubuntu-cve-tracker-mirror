Description: 
 The fix from CVE-2012-1823/CVE-2012-2311 only made PHP skip one
 php_getopt() call out of two that are reachable in the CGI mode
 (the third php_getopt() call is in the if (!cgi && !fastcgi) block).
 As the consequence, PHP was still parsing following arguments: 
   -h / -? - this seems harmless, as makes PHP output usage info,
    which triggers Internal Server Error in httpd
   -T - this was mentioned as DoS vector
