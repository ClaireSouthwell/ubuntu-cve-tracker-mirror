Description:
 When attempting to authenticate using API token, an ephemeral user
 record was created to validate the token in case an external security
 realm was used, and the user record in Jenkins not previously saved,
 as (legacy) API tokens could exist without a persisted user record.
 This behavior could be abused to create a large number of ephemeral
 user records in memory.
 The API token validation on authentication has been improved to no
 longer create ephemeral user records.
