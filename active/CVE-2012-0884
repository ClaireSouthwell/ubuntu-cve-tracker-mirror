Description:
 The implementation of Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and PKCS #7 in
 OpenSSL before 0.9.8u and 1.x before 1.0.0h does not properly restrict
 certain oracle behavior, which makes it easier for context-dependent
 attackers to decrypt data via a Million Message Attack (MMA) adaptive
 chosen ciphertext attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> only affects CMS, PKCS #7, or S/MIME decryption, not SSL/TLS
   transactions
 mdeslaur> from oss-security: "If a Linux distribution picks up the fix for
 mdeslaur> CVE-2012-0884 then they will want to pick up change 22161 at the
 mdeslaur> same time since the fix for the security vulnerability will
 mdeslaur> generally cause symmetric decryption errors when it kicks in and
 mdeslaur> things get very confusing for the end user without change 22161"
