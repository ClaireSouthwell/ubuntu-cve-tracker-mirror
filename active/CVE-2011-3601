Description: 
 A privilege escalation flaw was found in radvd, due to a buffer overflow
 in the process_ra() function.  ND_OPT_DNSSL_INFORMATION option parsing
 "label_len" was not checked for negative values, leading to a "suffix"
 buffer overflow which can lead to privilege escalation, at least if
 radvd is compiled without GCC's stack protection. If radvd is invoked
 without privilege separation (the -u option), this can lead to an
 escalation to root privileges.  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux starts
 radvd by default with the unprivileged user.
