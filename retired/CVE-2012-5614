Description:
 Oracle MySQL 5.1.67 and earlier and 5.5.29 and earlier, and MariaDB 5.5.28a
 and possibly other versions, allows remote authenticated users to cause a
 denial of service (mysqld crash) via a SELECT command with an UpdateXML
 command containing XML with a large number of unique, nested elements.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> as of 2013-02-20, no new version from upstream
 jdstrand> per mariadb developers, this CVE is not correct (see
  http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/28/10). Essentially, the
  UpdateXML part was introduced in 5.6.6 and fixed in 5.6.10. Ubuntu does not
  ship MySQL 5.6. This CVE was also linked to an invalid packet vulnerability
  (https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-3910), but this only existed in
  5.5.18 and was fixed in 5.5.21. Since there is no 5.6 in Ubuntu and the
  invalid packet issue was introduced in 5.5.18, marking this as fixed in
  mysql-5.5 5.5.21 and mysql-dfsg-5.1 and mysql-5.1 as not-affected.
