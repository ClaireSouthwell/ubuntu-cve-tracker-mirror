Description:
 In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the other party
 DH public key is not fully validated. This can cause issues as invalid keys
 can be used to reveal details about the other party's private key where
 static Diffie-Hellman is in use. As of release 1.56 the key parameters are
 checked on agreement calculation.
