Candidate: CVE-2006-4006
References:
Description:
 The do_gameinfo function in BomberClone 0.11.6 and earlier, and possibly
 other functions, does not reset the packet data size, which causes the
 send_pkg function (packets.c) to use this data size when sending a reply,
 and allows remote attackers to read portions of server memory.
