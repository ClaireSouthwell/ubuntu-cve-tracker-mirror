Description:
 Off-by-one error in the inflate function in Zlib.xs in Compress::Raw::Zlib
 Perl module before 2.017, as used in AMaViS, SpamAssassin, and possibly
 other products, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (hang or crash) via a crafted zlib compressed stream that triggers
 a heap-based buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild by
 Trojan.Downloader-71014 in June 2009.
