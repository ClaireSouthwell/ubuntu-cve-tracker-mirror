Description:
 The urllib and urllib2 modules in Python 2.x before 2.7.2 and 3.x before
 3.2.1 process Location headers that specify redirection to file: URLs,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
 or cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a crafted URL, as
 demonstrated by the file:///etc/passwd and file:///dev/zero URLs.
