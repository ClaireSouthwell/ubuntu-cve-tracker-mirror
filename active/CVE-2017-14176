Description: 
 A malicious third-party can give a crafted "ssh://..." URL to an
 unsuspecting victim using Bazaar, and an attempt to visit the URL can result
 in any program that exists on the victim's machine being executed.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Adam Collard discovered that Bazaar did not properly handle host names
 in 'bzr+ssh://' URLs. A remote attacker could use this to construct
 a bazaar repository URL that when accessed could run arbitrary code
 with the privileges of the user.
