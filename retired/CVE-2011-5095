Description:
 The Diffie-Hellman key-exchange implementation in OpenSSL 0.9.8, when FIPS
 mode is enabled, does not properly validate a public parameter, which makes
 it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain the shared secret key
 by modifying network traffic, a related issue to CVE-2011-1923.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> RedHat fixed this with the openssl-fips-0.9.8e-dh-check.patch
  patch in 0.9.8e-20.el5 by adding the DH_check_pub_key() check to
  fips/dh/fips_dh_key.c:compute_key()
 jdstrand> code not present in 1.0 series and the existing dh_key.c code
  already uses DH_check_pub_key() (as does the dh_key.c code in 0.9.8, but this
  is not used when compiled in fips mode). For details of 1.0's FIPS status,
  see http://www.openssl.org/docs/fips/fipsvalidation.html for details
 jdstrand> upstream has not included RedHat's patch in their 0.9.8 series
 jdstrand> fips_dh_key.c not compiled in Ubuntu
