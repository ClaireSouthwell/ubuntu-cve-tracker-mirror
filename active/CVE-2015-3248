Description:
 openhpi ships with the /var/lib/openhpi/ directory set world
 readable and writeable. If this directory is used for storing the
 OPENHPI_UID_MAP or other openhpi data for example an attacker would
 be able to view, modify and delete it. Even without such usage an
 attacker could use it to fill up the storage hosting the /var/lib/
 directory if quotas are not properly set.
