Description:
 session.c in the session extension in PHP before 5.2.13, and 5.3.1, does
 not properly interpret ; (semicolon) characters in the argument to the
 session_save_path function, which allows context-dependent attackers to
 bypass open_basedir and safe_mode restrictions via an argument that
 contains multiple ; characters in conjunction with a .. (dot dot).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> actually fixed in 5.3.2
 mdeslaur> open_basedir and safe_mode issue
 mdeslaur> dapper doesn't try and strip ; chars, so not vulnerable
