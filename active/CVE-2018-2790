Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
 6u181, 7u171, 8u162 and 10; Java SE Embedded: 8u161. Difficult to exploit
 vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
 multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
 attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker.
 Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update,
 insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible
 data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in
 clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
 applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
 internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
 does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run
 only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base
 Score 3.1 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not
 correctly perform merging of multiple sections for the same file
 listed in JAR archive file manifests. An attacker could possibly
 use this to modify attributes in a manifest without invalidating
 the signature.
