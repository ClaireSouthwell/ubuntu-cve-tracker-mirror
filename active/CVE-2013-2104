Description:
 vulnerability in expiry checks for PKI tokens in the Keystone authentication
 middleware. Expired tokens for authenticated users could continue to be used,
 potentially resulting in the bypass of intended security policies. The effect
 of PKI token revocation is also reversed when the token expires, in the sense
 that a revoked token is once again treated as being valid. Only setups using
 PKI tokens are affected.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per upstream, code introduced in keystone in Folsom (Ubuntu 12.10).
  For Grizzly (13.10), code moved to python-keystoneclient
 jdstrand> PKI tokens not available on Essex (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS)
 jdstrand> PKI are not used by default in Folsom (Ubuntu 12.10)
 jdstrand> the update for 12.10 was superseded by an SRU. While keystone in
  12.10 uses UUID tokens instead of PKI tokens, an update will be provided for
  12.10 soon.
