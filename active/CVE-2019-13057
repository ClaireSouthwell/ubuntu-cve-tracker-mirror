Description:
 An issue was discovered in the server in OpenLDAP before 2.4.48. When the
 server administrator delegates rootDN (database admin) privileges for
 certain databases but wants to maintain isolation (e.g., for multi-tenant
 deployments), slapd does not properly stop a rootDN from requesting
 authorization as an identity from another database during a SASL bind or
 with a proxyAuthz (RFC 4370) control. (It is not a common configuration to
 deploy a system where the server administrator and a DB administrator enjoy
 different levels of trust.)
