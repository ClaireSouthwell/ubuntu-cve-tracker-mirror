Description:
 A flaw was found in the way 389 Directory Server handled password changes.
 If an LDAP user has changed their password, and the directory server has
 not been restarted since that change, an attacker able to bind to the
 directory server could obtain the plain text version of that user's
 password via the "unhashed#user#password" attribute.
