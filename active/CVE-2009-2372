Description:
 Drupal 6.x before 6.13 does not prevent users from modifying user
 signatures after the associated comment format has been changed to an
 administrator-controlled input format, which allows remote authenticated
 users to inject arbitrary web script, HTML, and possibly PHP code via a
 crafted user signature.
