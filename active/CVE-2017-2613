Description:
 When administrators accessed a URL like /user/example via HTTP GET, a
 user with the ID example was created if it did not exist. While this user
 record was only retained until restart in most cases, administrators' web
 browsers could be manipulated to create a large number of user records.

 Accessing these URLs now no longer results in a user record getting
 created, Jenkins will respond with 404 Not Found if no such user
 exists. When using the internal Jenkins user database, new users can
 be created via Manage Jenkins Â» Manage Users.
