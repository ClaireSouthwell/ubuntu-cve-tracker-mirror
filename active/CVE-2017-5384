Description:
 Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) files can specify a JavaScript function called for all
 URL requests with the full URL path which exposes more information than would
 be sent to the proxy itself in the case of HTTPS. Normally the Proxy
 Auto-Config file is specified by the user or machine owner and presumed to be
 non-malicious, but if a user has enabled Web Proxy Auto Detect (WPAD) this
 file can be served remotely.
