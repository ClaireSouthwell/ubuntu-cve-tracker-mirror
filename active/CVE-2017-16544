Description:
 In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox through 1.27.2,
 the tab autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames
 in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing any
 escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially result in code
 execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.
