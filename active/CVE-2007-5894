Description:
 The reply function in ftpd.c in the gssftp ftpd in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5)
 does not initialize the length variable when auth_type has a certain value,
 which has unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors.  NOTE:
 the original disclosure misidentifies the conditions under which the
 uninitialized variable is used.
