Description:
 lib/fsm.c in RPM 4.8.0 and unspecified 4.7.x and 4.6.x versions, and RPM
 before 4.4.3, does not properly reset the metadata of an executable file
 during replacement of the file in an RPM package upgrade, which might allow
 local users to gain privileges by creating a hard link to a vulnerable (1)
 setuid or (2) setgid file.
