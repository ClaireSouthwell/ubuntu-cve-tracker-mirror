Description:
 The sdump function in sdump.c in fetchmail 6.3.11, 6.3.12, and 6.3.13, when
 running in verbose mode on platforms for which char is signed, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code via an SSL X.509 certificate containing
 non-printable characters with the high bit set, which triggers a heap-based
 buffer overflow during escaping.
