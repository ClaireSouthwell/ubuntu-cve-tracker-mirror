Description:
 Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in the PrintWebViewHelper class in
 components/printing/renderer/print_web_view_helper.cc in Google Chrome
 before 45.0.2454.85 allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering nested
 IPC messages during preparation for printing, as demonstrated by messages
 associated with PDF documents in conjunction with messages about printer
 capabilities.
