Description:
 Interpretation conflict in the Sun Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows
 user-assisted remote attackers to conduct a multi-pin DNS rebinding attack
 and execute arbitrary JavaScript in an intranet context, when an intranet
 web server has an HTML document that references a "mayscript=true" Java
 applet through a local relative URI, which may be associated with different
 IP addresses by the browser and the JVM.
