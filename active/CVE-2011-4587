Description:
 lib/moodlelib.php in Moodle 1.9.x before 1.9.15, 2.0.x before 2.0.6, and
 2.1.x before 2.1.3 does not properly handle certain zero values in the
 password policy, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
 access by leveraging the possible existence of user accounts that have
 unchangeable blank passwords.
