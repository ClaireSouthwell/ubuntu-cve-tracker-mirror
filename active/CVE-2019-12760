Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** A deserialization vulnerability exists in the way parso
 through 0.4.0 handles grammar parsing from the cache. Cache loading relies
 on pickle and, provided that an evil pickle can be written to a cache
 grammar file and that its parsing can be triggered, this flaw leads to
 Arbitrary Code Execution. NOTE: This is disputed because "the cache
 directory is not under control of the attacker in any common
 configuration."
