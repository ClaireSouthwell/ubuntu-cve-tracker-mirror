Description:
 Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in index.php in phpMyAdmin 2.8.0 through
 2.9.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
 by injecting arbitrary JavaScript or HTML in a (1) db or (2) table
 parameter value followed by an uppercase </SCRIPT> end tag, which bypasses
 the protection against lowercase </script>.
