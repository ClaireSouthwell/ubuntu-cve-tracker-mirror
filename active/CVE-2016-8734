Description:
 Unrestricted XML entity expansion in mod_dontdothat and Subversion clients
 using http(s)://
Ubuntu-Description:
 Florian Weimer discovered that Subversion clients did not properly
 restrict XML entity expansion when accessing http(s):// URLs. A remote
 attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.
Notes:
 mdeslaur> for mod_dontdothat, we don't ship it in binary packages
 mdeslaur> for clients, we build with serf, so we're vulnerable
