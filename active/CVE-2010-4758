Description:
 installer.pl in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 3.0.3 has an
 Inbound Mail Password field that uses the text type, instead of the
 password type, for its INPUT element, which makes it easier for physically
 proximate attackers to obtain the password by reading the workstation
 screen.
