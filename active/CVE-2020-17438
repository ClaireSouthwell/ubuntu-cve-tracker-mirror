Description: 
 The code that reassembles fragmented packets (uip_reass() in uip.c)
 fails to properly validate the total length of an incoming packet
 specified in its IP header, as well as the fragmentation offset value
 specified in the IP header. By crafting a packet with specific
 values of the IP header length and the fragmentation offset,
 attackers can write into the .bss section of the program past the
 statically allocated buffer that is used for storing the fragmented
 data, and cause a DoS/RCE (RCE highly depends on the architecture
 of the target platform).
