Description:
 The internal DNS server in Samba 4.x before 4.0.18 does not check the QR
 field in the header section of an incoming DNS message before sending a
 response, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
 and bandwidth consumption) via a forged response packet that triggers a
 communication loop, a related issue to CVE-1999-0103.
