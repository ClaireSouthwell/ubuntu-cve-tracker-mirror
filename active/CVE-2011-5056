Description:
 The authoritative server in MaraDNS through 2.0.04 computes hash values for
 DNS data without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions
 predictably, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service
 (CPU consumption) via crafted records in zone files, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2012-0024.
