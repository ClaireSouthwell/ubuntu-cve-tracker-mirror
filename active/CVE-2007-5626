Description:
 make_catalog_backup in Bacula 2.2.5, and probably earlier, sends a MySQL
 password as a command line argument, and sometimes transmits cleartext
 e-mail containing this command line, which allows context-dependent
 attackers to obtain the password by listing the process and its arguments,
 or by sniffing the network.
