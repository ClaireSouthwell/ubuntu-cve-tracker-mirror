Description:
 Qt 5.12.2 through 5.14.2, as used in unofficial builds of Mumble 1.3.0 and
 other products, mishandles OpenSSL's error queue, which can cause a denial
 of service to QSslSocket users. Because errors leak in unrelated TLS
 sessions, an unrelated session may be disconnected when any handshake
 fails. (Mumble 1.3.1 is not affected, regardless of the Qt version.)
