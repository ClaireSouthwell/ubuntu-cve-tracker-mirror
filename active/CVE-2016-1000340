Description:
 In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider versions 1.51 to 1.55, a carry
 propagation bug was introduced in the implementation of squaring for
 several raw math classes have been fixed
 (org.bouncycastle.math.raw.Nat???). These classes are used by our custom
 elliptic curve implementations (org.bouncycastle.math.ec.custom.**), so
 there was the possibility of rare (in general usage) spurious calculations
 for elliptic curve scalar multiplications. Such errors would have been
 detected with high probability by the output validation for our scalar
 multipliers.
