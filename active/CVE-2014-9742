Description:
 A bug in the Miller-Rabin primality test resulted in only a single random
 base being used instead of a sequence of such bases. This increased the
 probability that a non-prime would be accepted by is_prime or that a
 randomly generated prime might actually be composite. The probability
 of a random 1024 bit number being incorrectly classed as prime with a
 single base is around 2^-40.
