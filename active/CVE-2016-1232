Description:
 It was discovered that Prosody's generation of the secret token for
 server-to-server dialback authentication relied upon a weak random
 number generator that was not cryptographically secure. This allows an
 attacker to guess at probable values of the secret key. A successful
 guess allows impersonation of the affected domain to other servers on
 the network.
