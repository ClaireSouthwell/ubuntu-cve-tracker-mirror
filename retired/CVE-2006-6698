Description:
 The GConf daemon (gconfd) in GConf 2.14.0 creates temporary files under
 directories with names based on the username, even when GCONF_GLOBAL_LOCKS
 is not set, which allows local users to cause a denial of service by
 creating the directories ahead of time, which prevents other users from
 using Gnome.
