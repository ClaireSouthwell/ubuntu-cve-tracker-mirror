Description:
 Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0 of the SKS
 keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky to have a GnuPG
 keyserver configuration line referring to a host on the SKS keyserver
 network. Retrieving data from this network may cause a persistent denial of
 service, because of a Certificate Spamming Attack.
