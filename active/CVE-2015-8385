Description:
 PCRE before 8.38 mishandles the /(?|(\k'Pm')|(?'Pm'))/ pattern and related
 patterns with certain forward references, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a
 JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> Issue affects PCRE3 only
 tyhicks> Marking 'low' since it requires PCRE to operate on untrusted regular
  expressions which is not very likely
