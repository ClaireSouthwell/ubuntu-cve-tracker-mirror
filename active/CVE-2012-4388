Description:
 The sapi_header_op function in main/SAPI.c in PHP 5.4.0RC2 through 5.4.0
 does not properly determine a pointer during checks for %0D sequences (aka
 carriage return characters), which allows remote attackers to bypass an
 HTTP response-splitting protection mechanism via a crafted URL, related to
 improper interaction between the PHP header function and certain browsers,
 as demonstrated by Internet Explorer and Google Chrome.  NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-1398.
