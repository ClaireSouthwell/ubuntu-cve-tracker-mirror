Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle
 Java SE (subcomponent: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are
 Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151; JRockit:
 R28.3.16. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
 with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE
 Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a
 person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability
 can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service
 (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This
 vulnerability applies to client and server deployment of Java. This
 vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start
 applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by
 supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed
 Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a
 web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).

 validate objects when performing deserialization. An attacker could
 use this to cause a denial of service (application crash or excessive
 memory consumption).
