Description:
 The Korn shell (aka mksh) before R33d on MirOS (aka MirBSD) does not flush
 the tty's I/O when invoking mksh in a new terminal, which allows local
 users to gain privileges by opening a virtual terminal and entering command
 sequences, which might later be executed in opportunistic circumstances by
 a different user who launches mksh and specifies that terminal with the -T
 option.
