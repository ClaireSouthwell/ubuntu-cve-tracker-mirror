Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the calendar extension in PHP through 5.6.7
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted year value to (1) the GregorianToSdn
 function in gregor.c or (2) the JulianToSdn function in julian.c, as
 demonstrated by a crafted third argument to the gregoriantojd or juliantojd
 function.
