Description: 
 Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel(R)
 Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable
 information disclosure via local access.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Moritz Lipp, Andreas Kogler, Daniel Gruss, Michael Schwarz, and David
 Oswald discovered that the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL)
 feature of some Intel processors allowed a side-channel attack based on
 power consumption measurements. A local attacker could possibly use
 this to expose sensitive information.
