Description:
 plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x
 before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the
 permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace
 the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances
 involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote
 authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to
 read or modify a mailbox.
