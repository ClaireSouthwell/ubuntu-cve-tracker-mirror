Description:
 University of Washington IMAP Toolkit 2007f on UNIX, as used in imap_open()
 in PHP and other products, launches an rsh command (by means of the
 imap_rimap function in c-client/imap4r1.c and the tcp_aopen function in
 osdep/unix/tcp_unix.c) without preventing argument injection, which might
 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands if the IMAP server
 name is untrusted input (e.g., entered by a user of a web application) and
 if rsh has been replaced by a program with different argument semantics.
 For example, if rsh is a link to ssh (as seen on Debian and Ubuntu
 systems), then the attack can use an IMAP server name containing a
 "-oProxyCommand" argument.
