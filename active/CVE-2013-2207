Description:
 pt_chown in GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.18 does not
 properly check permissions for tty files, which allows local users to
 change the permission on the files and obtain access to arbitrary
 pseudo-terminals by leveraging a FUSE file system.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> patch disables building of pt_chown
 mdeslaur> We can't just remove pt_chown from older releases, as
 mdeslaur> unfortunately a lot of stuff still needs it, like lxc for
 mdeslaur> example. We'll need to identify them first and fix them at the
 mdeslaur> same time.
