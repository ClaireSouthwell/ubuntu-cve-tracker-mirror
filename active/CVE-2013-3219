Description:
 bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.x before 0.8.1 do not enforce a certain block
 protocol rule, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
 restrictions and conduct double-spending attacks via a large block that
 triggers incorrect Berkeley DB locking in older product versions.
