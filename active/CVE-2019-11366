Description:
 An issue was discovered in atftpd in atftp 0.7.1. It does not lock the
 thread_list_mutex mutex before assigning the current thread data structure.
 As a result, the daemon is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to
 a NULL pointer dereference. If thread_data is NULL when assigned to
 current, and modified by another thread before a certain tftpd_list.c
 check, there is a crash when dereferencing current->next.
