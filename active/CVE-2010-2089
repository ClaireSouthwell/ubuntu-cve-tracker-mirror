 http://bugs.python.org/issue7673
Description:
 The audioop module in Python 2.7 and 3.2 does not verify the relationships
 between size arguments and byte string lengths, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
 and application crash) via crafted arguments, as demonstrated by a call to
 audioop.reverse with a one-byte string, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2010-1634.
