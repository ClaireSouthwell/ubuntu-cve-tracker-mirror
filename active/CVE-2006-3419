Candidate: CVE-2006-3419
References: 
Description:
 Tor before 0.1.1.20 uses OpenSSL pseudo-random bytes (RAND_pseudo_bytes)
 instead of cryptographically strong RAND_bytes, and seeds the entropy value
 at start-up with 160-bit chunks without reseeding, which makes it easier
 for attackers to conduct brute force guessing attacks.
