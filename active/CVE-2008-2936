Description: 
 Sebastian Krahmer of SuSE has found a privilege escalation problem.  On systems
 where an attacker can hardlink a root-owned symlink to for example /var/mail,
 Postfix may append mail to existing files that are owned by root and non-root
 accounts. This can happen on specific operating systems with specific Postfix
 configurations.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> requires postfix as delivery agent, no root alias, no mail delivered
   to root, and the 'mail' account (or an application in the 'mail' group) to
   be compromised
