Description:
 A Null-pointer dereference has been identified in the SCCP (Skinny) channel
 driver of Asterisk. When an SCCP client closes its connection to the server, a
 pointer in a structure is set to Null. If the client was not in the on-hook
 state at the time the connection was closed, this pointer is later
 dereferenced.

 A remote attacker with a valid SCCP ID can can use this vulnerability by
 closing a connection to the Asterisk server in certain call states (e.g. "Off
 hook") to crash the server. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would
 result in termination of the server, causing denial of service to legitimate
 users.
