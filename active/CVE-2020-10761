Description:
 An assertion failure issue was found in the Network Block Device(NBD)
 Server in all QEMU versions before QEMU 5.0.1. This flaw occurs when an
 nbd-client sends a spec-compliant request that is near the boundary of
 maximum permitted request length. A remote nbd-client could use this flaw
 to crash the qemu-nbd server resulting in a denial of service.
