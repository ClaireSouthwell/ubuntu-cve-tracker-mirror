Description:
 GNOME Shell 3.14.x before 3.14.1, when the Screen Lock feature is used,
 does not limit the aggregate memory consumption of all active PrtSc
 requests, which allows physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary
 commands on an unattended workstation by making many PrtSc requests and
 leveraging a temporary lock outage, and the resulting temporary shell
 availability, caused by the Linux kernel OOM killer.
