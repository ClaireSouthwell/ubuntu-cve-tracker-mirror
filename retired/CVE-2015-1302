Description:
 The PDF viewer in Google Chrome before 46.0.2490.86 does not properly
 restrict scripting messages and API exposure, which allows remote attackers
 to bypass the Same Origin Policy via an unintended embedder or unintended
 plugin loading, related to pdf.js and out_of_process_instance.cc.
