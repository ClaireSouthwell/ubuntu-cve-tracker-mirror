I reviewed spl-linux version 0.6.5.4-0ubuntu2 as checked into xenial; this
shouldn't be considered a full security audit, in fact it was fairly quick
as I've read much of this code over the years out of curiosity and
interest.

The SPL layer has an awkward job to do but does it well, and provides
in-kernel testing framework, which is all too rare.

Security team ACK for promoting spl-linux to main.

Thanks
