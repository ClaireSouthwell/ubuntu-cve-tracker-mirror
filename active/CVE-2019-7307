Description:
 Apport contains a TOCTTOU vulnerability when reading the users
 ~/.apport-ignore.xml file, which allows a local attacker to replace this
 file with a symlink to any other file on the system and so cause Apport to
 include the contents of this other file in the resulting crash report. The
 crash report could then be read by that user either by causing it to be
 uploaded and reported to Launchpad, or by leveraging some other
 vulnerability to read the resulting crash report, and so allow the user to
 read arbitrary files on the system.
