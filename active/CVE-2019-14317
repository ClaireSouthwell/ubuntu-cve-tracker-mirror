Description:
 wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.1.0 and earlier (formerly known as CyaSSL) generate
 biased DSA nonces. This allows a remote attacker to compute the long term
 private key from several hundred DSA signatures via a lattice attack. The
 issue occurs because dsa.c fixes two bits of the generated nonces.
