Description:
 The resolver in ISC BIND 9 through 9.8.1-P1 overwrites cached server names
 and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A
 record query, which allows remote attackers to trigger continued
 resolvability of revoked domain names via a "ghost domain names" attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> upstream advisory says they won't be releasing a fix for this
 mdeslaur> dns-sec is the workaround.
 mdeslaur> upstream apparently included the fix anyway:
 mdeslaur> 3282. [bug] Restrict the TTL of NS RRset to no more than that
 mdeslaur>             of the old NS RRset when replacing it.
 mdeslaur>             [RT #27792] [RT #27884]
