Description:
 Double free vulnerability in the krb5_def_store_mkey function in
 lib/kdb/kdb_default.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.5 has unknown impact and
 remote authenticated attack vectors.  NOTE: the free operations occur in
 code that stores the krb5kdc master key, and so the attacker must have
 privileges to store this key.
