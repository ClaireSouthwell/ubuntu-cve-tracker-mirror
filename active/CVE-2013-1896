Description:
 mod_dav.c in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.25 does not properly
 determine whether DAV is enabled for a URI, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a MERGE request in
 which the URI is configured for handling by the mod_dav_svn module, but a
 certain href attribute in XML data refers to a non-DAV URI.
