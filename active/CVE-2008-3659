Description:
 Buffer overflow in the memnstr function in PHP 4.4.x before 4.4.9 and PHP
 5.6 through 5.2.6 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via the delimiter
 argument to the explode function.  NOTE: the scope of this issue is limited
 since most applications would not use an attacker-controlled delimiter, but
 local attacks against safe_mode are feasible.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per Debian, php5 -d memory_limit=256M -r \
  '$res = explode(str_repeat("A",145999999),1);'
