Description:
 [This is a heap buffer overflow in Perl's regular expression compiler
  that overwrites memory allocated after the regular expression storage
  space with attacker supplied data. The heap overflow occurs due to a
  signed size_t integer overflow in the storage space calculations for
  nested regular expression quantifiers.

  An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if
  it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating
  regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the
  regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service
  attacks in this usage scenario.

  Additionally, the target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to
  allocate partial expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the
  overflow occurring. This requirement is unlikely to be met on 64bit
  systems.]
