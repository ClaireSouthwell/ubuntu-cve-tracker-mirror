Description: 
 The client creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the
 priority of the streams in a way which causes substantial churn to the
 priority tree. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a
 Denial-of-Service. Also known as "HTTP/2 Resource Loop / Priority
 Shuffling".
