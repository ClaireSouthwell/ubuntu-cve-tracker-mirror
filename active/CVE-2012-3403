Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw, leading to invalid free, was found in the
 way KISS CEL file format plug-in of Gimp, the GNU Image Manipulation Program,
 performed loading of certain palette files. A remote attacker could provide a
 specially-crafted KISS palette file that, when opened in Gimp would cause the
 CEL plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the user running the gimp executable.
