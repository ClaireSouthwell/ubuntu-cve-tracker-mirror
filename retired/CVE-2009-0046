Description:
 Sun GridEngine 5.3 and earlier does not properly check the return value
 from the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal function, which allows remote attackers to
 bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS
 signature for DSA and ECDSA keys, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.
