Description:
 An SSRF issue was discovered in OpenStack Glance before Newton. The
 'copy_from' feature in the Image Service API v1 allowed an attacker to
 perform masked network port scans. With v1, it is possible to create images
 with a URL such as 'http://localhost:22'. This could then allow an attacker
 to enumerate internal network details while appearing masked, since the
 scan would appear to originate from the Glance Image service.
