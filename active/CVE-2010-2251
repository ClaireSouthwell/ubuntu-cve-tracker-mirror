Description:
 The get1 command, as used by lftpget, in LFTP before 4.0.6 does not
 properly validate a server-provided filename before determining the
 destination filename of a download, which allows remote servers to create
 or overwrite arbitrary files via a Content-Disposition header that suggests
 a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a consequence of
 writing to a dotfile in a home directory.
