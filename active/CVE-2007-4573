Candidate: CVE-2007-4573
References: 
Description: 
 The IA32 system call emulation functionality in Linux kernel 2.4.x and 2.6.x
 before 2.6.22.7, when running on the x86_64 architecture, does not zero extend
 the eax register after the 32bit entry path to ptrace is used, which might
 allow local users to gain privileges by triggering an out-of-bounds access to
 the system call table using the %RAX register.
