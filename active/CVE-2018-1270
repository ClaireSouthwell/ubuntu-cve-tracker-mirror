Description:
 Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to
 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, allow applications to expose STOMP
 over WebSocket endpoints with a simple, in-memory STOMP broker through the
 spring-messaging module. A malicious user (or attacker) can craft a message
 to the broker that can lead to a remote code execution attack.
