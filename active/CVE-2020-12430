Description:
 An issue was discovered in qemuDomainGetStatsIOThread in qemu/qemu_driver.c
 in libvirt 4.10.0 though 6.x before 6.1.0. A memory leak was found in the
 virDomainListGetStats libvirt API that is responsible for retrieving domain
 statistics when managing QEMU guests. This flaw allows unprivileged users
 with a read-only connection to cause a memory leak in the domstats command,
 resulting in a potential denial of service.
