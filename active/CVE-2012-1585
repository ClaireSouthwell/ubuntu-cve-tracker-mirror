Description: 
 Dan Prince reported a vulnerability in OpenStack Compute (Nova) API
 servers. By PUTing or POSTing extremely long server names to the
 OpenStack API, any authenticated user may grow nova-api log files
 significantly, potentially resulting in disk space exhaustion and
 denial of service to the affected nova-api nodes. Only setups running
 the OpenStack API are affected.
