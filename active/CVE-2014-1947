Description:
 The clarified meaning of CVE-2014-1947 is now the vulnerability in older
 ImageMagick versions (such as 6.5.4) that use the "L%02ld" string. The
 root cause here is that the code did not cover the case of more than 99
 layers, which is apparently allowable but relatively uncommon. This has a
 resultant buffer overflow, e.g, L99\0 is safe but L100\0 is unsafe. When
 the overflow occurs, it can be described as "1 or more bytes too many."
