Description:
 RT was vulnerable to limited session re-use when using the file-based
 session store, Apache::Session::File. RT's default session configuration
 only uses Apache::Session::File for Oracle. RT instances using Oracle may
 be locally configured to use the database-backed Apache::Session::Oracle,
 in which case sessions are never re-used. The extent of session re-use
 is limited to information leaks of certain user preferences and caches,
 such as queue names available for ticket creation.
