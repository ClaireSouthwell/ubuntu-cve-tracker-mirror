Description:
 An issue was discovered in SoX 14.4.2. In xmalloc.h, there is an integer
 overflow on the result of multiplication fed into the lsx_valloc macro that
 wraps malloc. When the buffer is allocated, it is smaller than expected,
 leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in channels_start in remix.c.
