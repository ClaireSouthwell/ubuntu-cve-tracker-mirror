Description:
 In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the
 TIFFOpen function. A crafted input will lead to a denial of service attack.
 During the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked. The value of
 td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. In the
 ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc function is
 called based on td_imagelength. If we set the value of td_imagelength close
 to the amount of system memory, it will hang the system or trigger the OOM
 killer.
