Description: 
 There is a another risk where the `RespawnCommand` or `ProcCmdline`
 fields in a crash file are executed when a user clicks "Restart" from
 the apport-gtk prompt.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that Apport would offer to restart an
 application based on the contents of the RespawnCommand or ProcCmdline
 fields in a crash file. An attacker could use this to convince a
 user to open a maliciously crafted crash file and execute arbitrary
 code with the privileges of that user.
