Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Squid 3.1.9 allows remote attackers to bypass the access
 configuration for the CONNECT method by providing an arbitrary allowed
 hostname in the Host HTTP header.  NOTE: this issue might not be
 reproducible, because the researcher is unable to provide a squid.conf file
 for a vulnerable system, and the observed behavior is consistent with a
 squid.conf file that was (perhaps inadvertently) designed to allow access
 based on a "req_header Host" acl regex that matches www.uol.com.br.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Need to check, see reproducer in original post
 sbeattie> dropping to low, as it requires a specific configuration
 sbeattie> using Host header filtering
 sbeattie> also, upstream does not have a fix for this.
 sarnold> still unable to find a configuration that could demonstrate the
 sarnold> problem; as of 2013-01-28, no fix from upstream either.
