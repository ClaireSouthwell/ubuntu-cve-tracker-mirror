Description:
 It was found that FreeIPA 4.2.0 and later could disclose password hashes to
 users having the 'System: Read Stage Users' permission. A remote,
 authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to disclose the
 password hashes belonging to Stage Users. This security issue does not
 result in disclosure of password hashes belonging to active standard users.
 NOTE: some developers feel that this report is a suggestion for a design
 change to Stage User activation, not a statement of a vulnerability.
