Description:
 An authorization bypass vulnerability was found in Ceph versions 15.2.0
 before 15.2.2, where the ceph-mon and ceph-mgr daemons do not properly
 restrict access, resulting in gaining access to unauthorized resources.
 This flaw allows an authenticated client to modify the configuration and
 possibly conduct further attacks.
