Description:
 A user of the Asterisk Manager Interface can bypass a security check and
 execute shell commands when they lack permission to do so. Under normal
 conditions, a user should only be able to run shell commands if that user has
 System class authorization. Users could bypass this restriction by using the
 MixMonitor application with the originate action or by using either the GetVar
 or Status manager actions in combination with the SHELL and EVAL functions.
 The patch adds checks in each affected action to verify if a user has System
 class authorization. If the user does not have those authorizations, Asterisk
 rejects the action if it detects the use of any functions or applications that
 run system commands.
