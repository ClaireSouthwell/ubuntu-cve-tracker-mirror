Description:
 Oracle Glassfish 2.1.1, 3.0.1, and 3.1.1, as used in Communications Server
 2.0, Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 and 8.2, and possibly other
 products, computes hash values for form parameters without restricting the
 ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many
 crafted parameters, aka Oracle security ticket S0104869.
