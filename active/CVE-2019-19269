Description:
 An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. A
 dereference of a NULL pointer may occur. This pointer is returned by the

 installed by a system administrator. The dereference occurs when validating
 the certificate of a client connecting to the server in a TLS client/server
 mutual-authentication setup.
