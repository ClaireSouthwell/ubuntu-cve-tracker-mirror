Description:
 The III_i_stereo function in libmpg123/layer3.c in mpg123 through 1.25.1
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and
 application crash) via a crafted audio file that is mishandled in the code
 for the "block_type != 2" case, a similar issue to CVE-2017-9870.
