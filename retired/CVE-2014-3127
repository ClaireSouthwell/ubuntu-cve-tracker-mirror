Description:
 dpkg 1.17.x before 1.17.9, 1.16.x before 1.16.14, and 1.15.x before 1.15.10
 for Debian squeeze and wheezy supports "C-style encoded filenames" while
 the patch program does not, which introduces an interaction error that
 allows attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and create files
 outside of the intended directories via a crafted package.  NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2014-0471.
