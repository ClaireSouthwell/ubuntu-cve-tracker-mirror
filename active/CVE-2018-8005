Description:
 When there are multiple ranges in a range request, Apache Traffic Server
 (ATS) will read the entire object from cache. This can cause performance
 problems with large objects in cache. This affects versions 6.0.0 to 6.2.2
 and 7.0.0 to 7.1.3. To resolve this issue users running 6.x users should
 upgrade to 6.2.3 or later versions and 7.x users should upgrade to 7.1.4 or
 later versions.
