Description:
 The *regs* macros in opcodes/bfin-dis.c in GNU Binutils 2.28 allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application
 crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file,
 as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
