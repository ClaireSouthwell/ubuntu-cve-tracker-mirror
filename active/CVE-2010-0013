Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in slp.c in the MSN protocol plugin in
 libpurple in Pidgin 2.6.4 and Adium 1.3.8 allows remote attackers to read
 arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in an application/x-msnmsgrp2p MSN
 emoticon (aka custom smiley) request, a related issue to CVE-2004-0122.
 NOTE: it could be argued that this is resultant from a vulnerability in
 which an emoticon download request is processed even without a preceding
 text/x-mms-emoticon message that announced availability of the emoticon.
