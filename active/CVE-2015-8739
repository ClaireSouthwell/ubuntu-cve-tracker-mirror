Description:
 The ipmi_fmt_udpport function in epan/dissectors/packet-ipmi.c in the IPMI
 dissector in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.1 improperly attempts to access a
 packet scope, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (assertion failure and application exit) via a crafted packet.
