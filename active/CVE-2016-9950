Description: 
 The Package or SourcePackage fields are not sanitized before being
 used to build a path to the package specific hook files in the
 /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/ directory.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that Apport did not properly sanitize
 the Package and SourcePackage fields in crash files before processing
 package specific hooks. An attacker could use this to convince a
 user to open a maliciously crafted crash file and execute arbitrary
 code with the privileges of that user.
