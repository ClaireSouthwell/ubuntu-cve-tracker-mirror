Description:
 While query forwarding and QNAME minimization are mutually incompatible,
 BIND did sometimes allow QNAME minimization when continuing with recursion
 after 'forward first' did not result in an answer.  In these cases the data
 used by QNAME minimization might be inconsistent, leading to an assertion
 failure, causing the server to exit. If a server is configured with both
 QNAME minimization and 'forward first' then an attacker who can send
 queries to it may be able to trigger the condition that will cause the
 server to crash.  Servers that 'forward only' are not affected.
