Description:
 389-ds-base before versions 1.4.0.9, 1.3.8.1, 1.3.6.15 did not properly
 handle long search filters with characters needing escapes, possibly
 leading to buffer overflows. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could
 potentially use this flaw to make ns-slapd crash via a specially crafted
 LDAP request, thus resulting in denial of service.
