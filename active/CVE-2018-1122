Description: 
 top reads its configuration file from the current working directory,
 without any security check, if the HOME environment variable is unset
 or empty. In this very unlikely scenario, an attacker can carry out an
 LPE (Local Privilege Escalation) if an administrator executes top in
 /tmp (for example), by exploiting one of several vulnerabilities in
 top's config_file() function.
