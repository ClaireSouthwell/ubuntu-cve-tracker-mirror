Description:
 t1lib 5.1.2 and earlier, as used in Xpdf before 3.02pl6 and other products,
 reads from invalid memory locations, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted Type 1 font in a PDF
 document, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-0764.
