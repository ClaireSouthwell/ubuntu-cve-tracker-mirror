Description:
 The (1) config.guess, (2) contrib/groffer/perl/groffer.pl, and (3)
 contrib/groffer/perl/roff2.pl scripts in GNU troff (aka groff) 1.21 and
 earlier use an insufficient number of X characters in the template argument
 to the tempfile function, which makes it easier for local users to
 overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a temporary file, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2004-0969.
