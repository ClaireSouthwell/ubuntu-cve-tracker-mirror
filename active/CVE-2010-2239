Description: 
 It was found that libvirt did not explicitly set the user defined backing
 store format when creating new image. This results in images being created
 with an potentialy insecure configuration, preventing applications from
 opening backing stores without resorting to probing. A priviledged guest user
 could use this flaw to access arbitrary files on the host.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> AppArmor in Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 should protect the host OS, but
  an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another
  machine.
 jdstrand> upstream patch is highly intrusive, needs rewriting for all affected
  releases, requires a conffile change and potentially a migration helper.
