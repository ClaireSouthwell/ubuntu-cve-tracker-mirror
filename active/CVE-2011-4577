Description: 
 RFC 3779 data can be included in certificates, and if it is malformed,
 may trigger an assertion failure. This could be used in a
 denial-of-service attack.
 Note, however, that in the standard release of OpenSSL, RFC 3779
 support is disabled by default, and in this case OpenSSL is not
 vulnerable. Builds of OpenSSL are vulnerable if configured with 
 "enable-rfc3779".
