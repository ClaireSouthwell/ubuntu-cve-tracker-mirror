Description:
 DB_LOOKUP in nss_files/files-XXX.c in the Name Service Switch (NSS) in GNU
 C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.21 and earlier does not properly check if
 a file is open, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (infinite loop) by performing a look-up while the database is iterated over
 the database, which triggers the file pointer to be reset.
