Description:
 The odbc_bindcols function in ext/odbc/php_odbc.c in PHP before 5.6.12
 mishandles driver behavior for SQL_WVARCHAR columns, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) in opportunistic
 circumstances by leveraging use of the odbc_fetch_array function to access
 a certain type of Microsoft SQL Server table.
