 https://github.com/TElgamal/attack-on-pycrypto-elgamal
Description:
 lib/Crypto/PublicKey/ElGamal.py in PyCrypto through 2.6.1 generates weak
 ElGamal key parameters, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive
 information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic
 security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional
 Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for PyCrypto's ElGamal
 implementation.
