Description:
 The broadcast mode of NTP is expected to only be used in a trusted
 network. If the broadcast network is accessible to an attacker, a
 potentially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in ntpd's
 broadcast mode replay prevention functionality can be abused. An attacker
 with access to the NTP broadcast domain can periodically inject specially
 crafted broadcast mode NTP packets into the broadcast domain which, while
 being logged by ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from
 legitimate NTP broadcast servers.
