Description: 
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 dbus-daemon tracks whether method call messages expect a reply, so that
 unsolicited replies can be dropped. As currently implemented, if there
 are n parallel method calls in progress, each method reply takes O(n)
 CPU time. A malicious user can exploit this by opening the maximum
 allowed number of parallel connections and sending the maximum number of
 parallel method calls on each one, causing subsequent method calls to be
 unreasonably slow, a denial of service.
