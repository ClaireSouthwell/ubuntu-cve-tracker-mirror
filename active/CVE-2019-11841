Description:
 A message-forgery issue was discovered in
 crypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go in supplementary Go cryptography
 libraries 2019-03-25. According to the OpenPGP Message Format specification
 in RFC 4880 chapter 7, a cleartext signed message can contain one or more
 optional "Hash" Armor Headers. The "Hash" Armor Header specifies the
 message digest algorithm(s) used for the signature. However, the Go
 clearsign package ignores the value of this header, which allows an
 attacker to spoof it. Consequently, an attacker can lead a victim to
 believe the signature was generated using a different message digest
 algorithm than what was actually used. Moreover, since the library skips
 Armor Header parsing in general, an attacker can not only embed arbitrary
 Armor Headers, but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages
 without invalidating the signatures.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> snapd contains an embedded copy of golang-go.crypto
 jdstrand> the version of golang-go.crypto that is embedded does not contain
  the clearsign package. Nothing in the source uses the clearsign APIs
