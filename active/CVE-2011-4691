Description:
 Google Chrome 15.0.874.121 and earlier does not prevent capture of data
 about the times of Same Origin Policy violations during IFRAME loading
 attempts, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether a
 document exists in the browser cache via crafted JavaScript code.
