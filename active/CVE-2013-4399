Description:
 It was discovered that an unprivileged user with read-only access to a libvirt
 guest could connect to it and, by disconnecting, cause a crash of the guest if
 the access-driver ACLs were defined in libvirtd.conf.  This was due libvirtd
 not removing event callbacks, which would continue to trigger after the client
 disconnects, which would cause predictable use of free memory, resulting in a
 crash.
