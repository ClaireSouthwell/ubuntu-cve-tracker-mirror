Description:
 The (1) Conn_GetCipherInfo and (2) Conn_UsesSSL functions in
 src/ngircd/conn.c in ngIRCd 13 and 14, when SSL/TLS support is present and
 standalone mode is disabled, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) by sending the MOTD command from another server
 in the same IRC network, possibly related to an array index error.
