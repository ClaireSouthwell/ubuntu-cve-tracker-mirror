 https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/releases/tag/v4.0.2
Description:
 EpubCheck 4.0.1 does not properly restrict resolving external entities when
 parsing XML in EPUB files during validation. An attacker who supplies a
 specially crafted EPUB file may be able to exploit this behavior to read
 arbitrary files, or have the victim execute arbitrary requests on his
 behalf, abusing the victim's trust relationship with other entities.
