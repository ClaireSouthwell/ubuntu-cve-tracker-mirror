Description:
 grub2 fails to validate kernel signature when booted directly without
 shim, allowing secure boot to be bypassed. This only affects systems where
 the kernel signing certificate has been imported directly into the secure
 boot database and the grub image is booted directly without the use of
 shim.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre discovered that in certain situations,
 GRUB2 failed to validate kernel signatures. A local attacker could
 use this to bypass Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes:
 amurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)
  and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low
