Description:
 Direct static code injection vulnerability in includes/template.php in
 phpBB allows remote authenticated users with write access to execute
 arbitrary PHP code by modifying a template in a way that (1) bypasses a
 loose ".*" regular expression to match BEGIN and END statements in
 overall_header.tpl, or (2) is used in an eval statement by
 includes/bbcode.php for bbcode.tpl.
