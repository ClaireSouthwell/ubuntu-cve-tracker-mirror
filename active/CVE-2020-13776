Description:
 systemd through v245 mishandles numerical usernames such as ones composed
 of decimal digits or 0x followed by hex digits, as demonstrated by use of
 root privileges when privileges of the 0x0 user account were intended.
 NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-1000082.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> The administrator would have to create a systemd service unit
 mdeslaur> with a numerical username or a username starting with 0x as a
 mdeslaur> User= value, and that particular userid would need to exist on
 mdeslaur> the system. Setting priority to low due to this unlikely
 mdeslaur> scenario.
