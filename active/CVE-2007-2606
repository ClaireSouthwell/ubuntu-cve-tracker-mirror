Candidate: CVE-2007-2606
References: 
Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in Firebird 2.1 allow attackers to trigger memory
 corruption and possibly have other unspecified impact via certain input
 processed by (1) config\ConfigFile.cpp or (2) msgs\check_msgs.epp.  NOTE:
 if ConfigFile.cpp reads a configuration file with restrictive permissions,
 then the ConfigFile.cpp vector may not cross privilege boundaries and
 perhaps should not be included in CVE.
