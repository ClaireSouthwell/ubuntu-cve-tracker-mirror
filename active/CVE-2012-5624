Description:
 The XMLHttpRequest object in Qt is intended to offer similar behaviour to that
 in web browsers, though it intentionally does not enforce the same-orign
 policy. It has been determined that the implementation in Qt will allow
 redirection from http to file schemes which may allow an attacker performing a
 man-in-the-middle attack to cause QML applications to leak sensitive
 information.
