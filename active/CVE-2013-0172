Description:
 Samba 4.0.x before 4.0.1, in certain Active Directory domain-controller
 configurations, does not properly interpret Access Control Entries that are
 based on an objectClass, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass
 intended restrictions on modifying LDAP directory objects by leveraging (1)
 objectClass access by a user, (2) objectClass access by a group, or (3)
 write access to an attribute.
