Description:
 Tomcat provides several session persistence mechanisms. The
 StandardManager persists session over a restart. The PersistentManager
 is able to persist sessions to files, a database or a custom Store. The
 Cluster implementation persists sessions to one or more additional
 nodes in the cluster. All of these mechanisms could be exploited to
 bypass a security manager. Session persistence is performed by Tomcat
 code with the permissions assigned to Tomcat internal code. By placing
 a carefully crafted object into a session, a malicious web application
 could trigger the execution of arbitrary code.
