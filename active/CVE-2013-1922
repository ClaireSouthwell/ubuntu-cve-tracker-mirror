Description: 
 A security flaw was found in the way qemu-nbd, the QEMU Disk Network
 Block Device server tool of QEMU, performed detection of image formats
 (the image format has been previously autodetected). A guest operating
 system administrator could write a header to particular raw disk image
 format, describing another format than original one for that disk image,
 leading to scenario in which after restart of that guest, QEMU would
 detect new format of the image, and could allow the guest to read any
 file on the host if QEMU was sufficiently privileged.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes:
 jdstrand> patch removes autodetection and forces the use of new --format
  argument. Will need to see what uses qemu-nbd and verify it works ok.
