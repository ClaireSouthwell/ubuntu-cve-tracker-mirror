Description:
 A flaw was found in the way Serf handled NUL characters in the CommonName
 and SubjectAltNames fields of X.509 certificates. An attacker able to
 get a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a trusted Certificate
 Authority could trick applications using Serf into accepting it by
 mistake, allowing the attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
