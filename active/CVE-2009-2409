 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-810-1
Description:
 The Network Security Services (NSS) library before 3.12.3, as used in
 Firefox; GnuTLS before 2.6.4 and 2.7.4; OpenSSL 0.9.8 through 0.9.8k; and
 other products support MD2 with X.509 certificates, which might allow
 remote attackers to spoof certificates by using MD2 design flaws to
 generate a hash collision in less than brute-force time.  NOTE: the scope
 of this issue is currently limited because the amount of computation
 required is still large.
