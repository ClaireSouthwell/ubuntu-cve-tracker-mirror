Description:
 PHP 5.2.11, and 5.3.x before 5.3.1, does not restrict the number of
 temporary files created when handling a multipart/form-data POST request,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
 exhaustion), and makes it easier for remote attackers to exploit local file
 inclusion vulnerabilities, via multiple requests, related to lack of
 support for the max_file_uploads directive.
