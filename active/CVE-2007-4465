Description: 
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod_autoindex.c in the Apache HTTP
 Server before 2.2.6, when the charset on a server-generated page is not
 defined, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the
 P parameter using the UTF-7 charset. NOTE: it could be argued that this issue
 is due to a design limitation of browsers that attempt to perform automatic
 content type detection.
