Description:
 The (1) ncpmount, (2) ncpumount, and (3) ncplogin programs in ncpfs 2.2.6
 do not properly create lock files, which allows local users to cause a
 denial of service (application failure) via unspecified vectors that
 trigger the creation of a /etc/mtab~ file that persists after the program
 exits.
