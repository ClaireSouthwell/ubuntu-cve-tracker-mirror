Description:
 The ucnv_UTF8FromUTF8 function in ucnv_u8.cpp in International Components
 for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ through 60.1 mishandles ucnv_convertEx calls
 for UTF-8 to UTF-8 conversion, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string, as
 demonstrated by ZNC.
