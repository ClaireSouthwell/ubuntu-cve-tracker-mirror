Description: 
 Fuse uses the --no-canonicalize mount option to prevent a symlink attack
 on the mount point written to mtab. For backwards compatibility reasons,
 it would fallback to using mount in an insecure way. This fallback could
 get triggered by a user when an entry already existed in mtab.
