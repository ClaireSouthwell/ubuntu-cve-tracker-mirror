Description:
 It was found that gdk-pixbuf's gdk_pixbuf__gif_image_load() GIF image
 loader routine did not properly handle certain return values from its
 subroutines. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted GIF
 image, which once opened in an application, linked against gdk-pixbuf
 would lead to gdk-pixbuf to return partially initialized pixbuf
 structure, possibly having huge width and height, leading to that
 particular application termination due excessive memory use.
