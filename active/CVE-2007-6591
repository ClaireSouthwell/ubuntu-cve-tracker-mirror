Description:
 KDE Konqueror 3.5.5 and 3.95.00, when a user accepts an SSL server
 certificate on the basis of the CN domain name in the DN field, regards the
 certificate as also accepted for all domain names in subjectAltName:dNSName
 fields, even though these fields cannot be examined in the product, which
 makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into accepting an
 invalid certificate for a spoofed web site.
