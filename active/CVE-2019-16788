Description:
 In WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3.0, authenticated users who do not
 have the rights to publish a post are able to mark posts as sticky or
 unsticky via the REST API. For example, the contributor role does not have
 such rights, but this allowed them to bypass that. This has been patched in
 WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to
 5.3 via a minor release. Automatic updates are enabled by default for minor
 releases and we strongly recommend that you keep them enabled.
