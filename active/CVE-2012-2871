Description:
 libxml2 2.9.0-rc1 and earlier, as used in Google Chrome before
 21.0.1180.89, does not properly support a cast of an unspecified variable
 during handling of XSL transforms, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted
 document, related to the _xmlNs data structure in include/libxml/tree.h.
