Description:
 [off-by-one in dwarf_to_unw_regnum()]
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> I saw nothing in callers of this macro that would prevent
  less-than-zero accesses: input params were sometimes integers, sometimes
  harder to determine the type. Debian codesearch shows many duplications of
  the <= mistake with dwarf_to_unw_regnum arrays in other files, not just the
  one dwarf_i.h.
