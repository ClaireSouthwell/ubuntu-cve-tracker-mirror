Description:
 Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
 with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE,
 Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction
 from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this
 vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data
 or complete access to all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible
 data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
 typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications
 or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g.,
 code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
 security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments,
 typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g.,
 code installed by an administrator).
