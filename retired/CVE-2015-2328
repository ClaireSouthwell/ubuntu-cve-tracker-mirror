Description:
 PCRE before 8.36 mishandles the /((?(R)a|(?1)))+/ pattern and related
 patterns with certain recursion, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript
 RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.
