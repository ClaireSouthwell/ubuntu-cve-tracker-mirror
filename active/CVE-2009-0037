Description:
 The redirect implementation in curl and libcurl 5.11 through 7.19.3, when
 CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION is enabled, accepts arbitrary Location values, which
 might allow remote HTTP servers to (1) trigger arbitrary requests to
 intranet servers, (2) read or overwrite arbitrary files via a redirect to a
 file: URL, or (3) execute arbitrary commands via a redirect to an scp: URL.
