Description:
 qmp_guest_file_read in qga/commands-posix.c and qga/commands-win32.c in
 qemu-ga (aka QEMU Guest Agent) in QEMU 2.12.50 has an integer overflow
 causing a g_malloc0() call to trigger a segmentation fault when trying to
 allocate a large memory chunk. The vulnerability can be exploited by
 sending a crafted QMP command (including guest-file-read with a large count
 value) to the agent via the listening socket.
