Description:
 Race condition in the FastCopy optimization in the Array.Copy method in
 metadata/icall.c in Mono, when Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before
 3.99.3 is used, allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer overflow and
 modify internal data structures, and cause a denial of service (plugin
 crash) or corrupt the internal state of the security manager, via a crafted
 media file in which a thread makes a change after a type check but before a
 copy action.
