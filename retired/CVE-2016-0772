Description:
 The smtplib library in CPython (aka Python) before 2.7.12, 3.x before
 3.4.5, and 3.5.x before 3.5.2 does not return an error when StartTLS fails,
 which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the TLS protections
 by leveraging a network position between the client and the registry to
 block the StartTLS command, aka a "StartTLS stripping attack."
