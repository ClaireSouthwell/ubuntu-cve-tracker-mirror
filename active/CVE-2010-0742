Description:
 The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) implementation in
 crypto/cms/cms_asn1.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8o and 1.x before 1.0.0a does
 not properly handle structures that contain OriginatorInfo, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to modify invalid memory locations or conduct
 double-free attacks, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via unspecified
 vectors.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> Debian says CMS isn't enabled by default, so unimportant
