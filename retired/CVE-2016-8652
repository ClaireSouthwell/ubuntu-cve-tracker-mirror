Description:
 Dovecot auth component can be crashed by remote user when auth-policy
 component is activated. If auth-policy component has been activated
 in Dovecot, then remote user can use SASL authentication to crash auth
 component. Workaround is to disable auth-policy component until fix is
 in place. This can be done by commenting out all auth_policy_* settings.
