Description:
 The method Jenkins#getItems() included a performance optimization
 that resulted in all items being returned if the Logged in users can
 do anything authorization strategy was used, and no access was granted
 to anonymous users (an option added in Jenkins 2.0). This only affects
 anonymous users (other users legitimately have access) that were able
 to get a list of items via an UnprotectedRootAction.
