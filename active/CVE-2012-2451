Description:
 The Config::IniFiles module before 2.71 for Perl creates temporary files
 with predictable names, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary
 files via a symlink attack.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
 third party information.  NOTE: it has been reported that this might only
 be exploitable by writing in the same directory as the .ini file. If this
 is the case, then this issue might not cross privilege boundaries.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> file is created in the same directory as the original file and so
  yama won't protect against it since this doesn't have to occur in a sticky
  directory. Should not cross privilege boundaries, but is a useful hardening
  measure.
