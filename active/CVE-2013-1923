Description:
 rpc.gssd in nfs-utils is vulnerable to DNS spoofing due to it depending
 on PTR resolution for GSSAPI authentication. Because of this, if a user
 where able to poison DNS to a victim's computer, they would be able to
 trick rpc.gssd into talking to another server (perhaps with less
 security) than the intended server (with stricter security)
