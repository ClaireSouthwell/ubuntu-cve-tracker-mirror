Description:
 The client can request a large amount of data from a specified resource
 over multiple streams. It can manipulate window sizes and stream priority
 to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how
 efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or
 both, potentially leading to a Denial-of-Service. Also knows as "HTTP/2
 Data Dribble".
