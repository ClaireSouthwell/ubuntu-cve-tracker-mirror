Description:
 The documentation XML-RPC server in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through
 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4 has XSS via the server_title field. This
 occurs in Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py in Python 2.x, and in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py
 in Python 3.x. If set_server_title is called with untrusted input,
 arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered to clients that visit the http URL
 for this server.
