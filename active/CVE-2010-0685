Description:
 The design of the dialplan functionality in Asterisk Open Source 1.2.x,
 1.4.x, and 1.6.x; and Asterisk Business Edition B.x.x and C.x.x, when using
 the ${EXTEN} channel variable and wildcard pattern matches, allows
 context-dependent attackers to inject strings into the dialplan using
 metacharacters that are injected when the variable is expanded, as
 demonstrated using the Dial application to process a crafted SIP INVITE
 message that adds an unintended outgoing channel leg.  NOTE: it could be
 argued that this is not a vulnerability in Asterisk, but a class of
 vulnerabilities that can occur in any program that uses this feature
 without the associated filtering functionality that is already available.
