Candidate: CVE-2007-5029
References: 
Description: 
 Dibbler 0.6.0 does not verify that certain length parameters are appropriate
 for buffer sizes, which allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer over-read
 and cause a denial of service (daemon crash), as demonstrated by incorrect
 behavior of the TSrvMsg constructor in SrvMessages/SrvMsg.cpp when (1) reading
 the option code and option length and (2) parsing options.
