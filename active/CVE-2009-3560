Description:
 The big2_toUtf8 function in lib/xmltok.c in libexpat in Expat 2.0.1, as
 used in the XML-Twig module for Perl, allows context-dependent attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via an XML document with
 malformed UTF-8 sequences that trigger a buffer over-read, related to the
 doProlog function in lib/xmlparse.c, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2009-2625 and CVE-2009-3720.
