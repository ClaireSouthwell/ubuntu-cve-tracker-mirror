Description:
 The Instance::HandleInputEvent function in pdf/instance.cc in the PDFium
 component in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101 interprets a certain -1
 value as an index instead of a no-visible-page error code, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via
 unspecified vectors.
