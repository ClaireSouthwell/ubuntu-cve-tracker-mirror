Description:
 The PMA_ArrayWalkRecursive function in libraries/common.lib.php in
 phpMyAdmin before 2.10.0.2 does not limit recursion on arrays provided by
 users, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (web server crash) via an array with many dimensions.  NOTE: it
 could be argued that this vulnerability is caused by a problem in PHP
 (CVE-2006-1549) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this
 should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin.
