Description:
 By creating a delegation from a trust or OAuth token, a trustee may
 abuse the identity impersonation against keystone and circumvent the
 enforced scope, resulting in potential elevated privileges to any of
 the trustor's projects and or roles. All Keystone deployments configured
 to enable trusts are affected, which has been the default since Grizzly.
