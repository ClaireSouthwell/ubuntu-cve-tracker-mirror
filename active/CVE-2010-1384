Description:
 Apple Safari before 5.0 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and
 before 4.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, does not provide a warning about a (1) http or
 (2) https URL that contains a username and password, which makes it easier
 for remote attackers to conduct phishing attacks via a crafted URL.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from
  it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit.
 mdeslaur> webkitkde is a wrapper around qt4-x11's webkit.
 mdeslaur> misconception around browser security, probably not an issue
