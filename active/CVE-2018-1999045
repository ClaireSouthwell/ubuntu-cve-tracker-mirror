Description:
 The "Remember me" feature can be disabled in the Jenkins security
 configuration. This did not disable the processing of previously set
 "Remember me" cookies, so they still allowed users to be logged in.
 "Remember me" cookies are no longer evaluated when the corresponding
 feature is disabled.
