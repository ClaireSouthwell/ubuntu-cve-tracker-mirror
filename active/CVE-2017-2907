Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow exists in the animation playing
 functionality of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite version 2.78c. A
 specially created '.avi' file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a
 buffer overflow which can allow for code execution under the context of the
 application. An attacker can convince a user to use the file as an asset in
 order to trigger this vulnerability.
