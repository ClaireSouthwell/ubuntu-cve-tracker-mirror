Description:
 The pkinit_server_return_padata function in
 plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_srv.c in the PKINIT implementation in the Key
 Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.10.4
 attempts to find an agility KDF identifier in inappropriate circumstances,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
 dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted Draft 9 request.
