Description:
 Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.44, 7.x before 7.0.55, and 8.x before 8.0.9
 does not properly handle cases where an HTTP response occurs before
 finishing the reading of an entire request body, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (thread consumption) via a series of
 aborted upload attempts.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> ASF says this is a low severity issue that, unlike the original
 mdeslaur> description, can't cause memory consumption, only a limited
 mdeslaur> denial of service.
