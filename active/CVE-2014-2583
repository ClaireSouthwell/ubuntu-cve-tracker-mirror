Description:
 Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in pam_timestamp.c in the
 pam_timestamp module for Linux-PAM (aka pam) 1.1.8 allow local users to
 create aribitrary files or possibly bypass authentication via a .. (dot
 dot) in the (1) PAM_RUSER value to the get_ruser function or (2) PAM_TTY
 value to the check_tty funtion, which is used by the format_timestamp_name
 function.
