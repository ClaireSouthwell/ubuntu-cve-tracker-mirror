Description:
 The php_wddx_push_element function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.26
 and 7.x before 7.0.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (invalid pointer access and out-of-bounds read) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via an incorrect boolean element in a wddxPacket
 XML document, leading to mishandling in a wddx_deserialize call.
