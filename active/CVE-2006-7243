Description:
 PHP before 5.3.4 accepts the \0 character in a pathname, which might allow
 context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by
 placing a safe file extension after this character, as demonstrated by
 .php\0.jpg at the end of the argument to the file_exists function.

Notes:
 sbeattie> upstream only prepared a fix for the 5.3 tree. Backporting
 sbeattie> the fix to 5.2.x requires modifying php APIs.
