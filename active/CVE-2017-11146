Description:
 In PHP through 5.6.31, 7.x through 7.0.21, and 7.1.x through 7.1.7, lack of
 bounds checks in the date extension's timelib_meridian parsing code could
 be used by attackers able to supply date strings to leak information from
 the interpreter, related to ext/date/lib/parse_date.c out-of-bounds reads
 affecting the php_parse_date function. NOTE: this vulnerability exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-11145.
