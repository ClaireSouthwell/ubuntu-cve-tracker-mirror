Description:
 ntpd in ntp 4.2.x before 4.2.8p7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92 allows
 authenticated users that know the private symmetric key to create
 arbitrarily-many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection
 of ntpd and modify a victim's clock via a Sybil attack. This issue exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-1549.
