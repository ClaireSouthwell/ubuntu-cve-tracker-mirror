Description:
 The hashing implementation in Jansson, a library for encoding,
 decoding and manipulating JSON data, was susceptible to predictable
 hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an
 application using Jansson to use an excessive amount of CPU time by
 sending a crafted JSON document containing a large number of parameters
 whose names map to the same hash value.
