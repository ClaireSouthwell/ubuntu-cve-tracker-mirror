Description:
 The BGP implementation in bgpd in Quagga before 0.99.20.1 does not properly
 use message buffers for OPEN messages, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a message
 associated with a malformed Four-octet AS Number Capability (aka AS4
 capability).
