Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle Java SE and Java
 for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2_25, and 1.3.1_27 allows
 remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via
 unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the
 March 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable
 researcher that this is for improper parsing of a crafted MIDI stream when
 creating a MixerSequencer object, which causes a pointer to be corrupted
 and allows a NULL byte to be written to arbitrary memory.
