Description:
 The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer can run injected script content
 if a user pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS
 feeds or PDF files. This could allow a malicious site to socially engineer
 a user to copy and paste malicious script content that could then run with
 the context of either page but does not allow for privilege escalation.
 This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
