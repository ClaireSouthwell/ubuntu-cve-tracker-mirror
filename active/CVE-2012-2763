Description: 
 There is a buffer overflow in the script-fu server component of GIMP 
 (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) in all 2.6 versions (Windows and 
 Linux versions) affecting both the script-fu console and the script-fu
 network server. A crafted msg to the script-fu server overflows a buffer
 and overwrites several function pointers allowing the attacker to gain
 control of EIP and potentially execute arbitrary code. This issue is 
 fixed in the latest, stable GIMP version (currently 2.8.0).
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 tyhicks> The vast majority of gimp installs will not be using the script-fu
  network server
