Description:
 It was discovered that the RemoteObjectInvocationHandler class in the
 RMI component of OpenJDK did not check if object proxy is an instance
 of a proxy class and that it uses correct invocation handler.  An
 untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass
 certain Java sandbox restrictions by gaining access to data that should
 by protected by the sandbox.
