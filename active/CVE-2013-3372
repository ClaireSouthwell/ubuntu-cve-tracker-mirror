Description:
 RT is vulnerable to an HTTP header injection limited to the value
 of the Content-Disposition header. Injection of other arbitrary
 response headers is not possible. Some (especially older) browsers
 may allow multiple Content-Disposition values which could lead to XSS.
 Newer browsers contain security measures to prevent this.
