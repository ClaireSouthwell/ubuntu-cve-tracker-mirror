Canonical Supported Snaps
-------------------------
The Ubuntu Security Team track CVEs for Canonical supported snaps - these
are usually derived from sources outside the Ubuntu archive and so are
tracked separately.

Similar to product kernels, the usual '<release>_<source package>'
nomencalture is not applicable, so instead these are listed as
snap_<snap-name>.

-- Adding new supported snaps

If the snap name is 'foo':
1. update 'supported_snaps' in scripts/cve_lib.py to include 'foo' along
   with its git tree and LP/Github project or to file bugs against. Eg:
   supported_snaps = {...,
                      'foo': ('http://git.url/...',
                              'https://launchpad.net/project...'),
                      }

With the above:
 * check-syntax will verify supported snaps
 * html_export.py will export html relevant for a supported snap
