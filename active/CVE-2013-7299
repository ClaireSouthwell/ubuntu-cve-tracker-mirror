Description:
 By sending a crafted HTTP request that uses "\n" to end its headers
 instead of the expected "\r\n", it is possible that headers from a
 previous unrelated request will seemingly be appended to the crafted
 request (due to a missing null termination). This allows a remote
 attacker to use sensitive headers from other users' requests in their
 own requests, such as cookies or HTTP authentication credentials.
