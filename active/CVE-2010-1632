Description:
 Apache Axis2 before 1.5.2, as used in IBM WebSphere Application Server
 (WAS) 7.0 through 7.0.0.12, IBM Feature Pack for Web Services 6.1.0.9
 through 6.1.0.32, IBM Feature Pack for Web 2.0 1.0.1.0, Apache Synapse,
 Apache ODE, Apache Tuscany, Apache Geronimo, and other products, does not
 properly reject DTDs in SOAP messages, which allows remote attackers to
 read arbitrary files, send HTTP requests to intranet servers, or cause a
 denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via a crafted DTD, as
 demonstrated by an entity declaration in a request to the Synapse
 SimpleStockQuoteService.
