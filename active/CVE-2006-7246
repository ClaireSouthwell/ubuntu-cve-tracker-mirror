Description: 
  When 802.11X authentication is used (ie WPA Enterprise)
  NetworkManager did not pin a certificate's subject to an ESSID. A
  rogue access point could therefore be used to conduct MITM attacks
  by using any other valid certificate issued by the same CA as
  used in the original network (CVE-2006-7246). If password based
  authentication is used (e.g. via PEAP or EAP-TTLS) this means an
  attacker could sniff and potentially crack the password hashes of
  the victims.
