Description:
 The caml_ba_deserialize function in byterun/bigarray.c in the standard
 library in OCaml 4.06.0 has an integer overflow which, in situations where
 marshalled data is accepted from an untrusted source, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted object.
