Description:
 An issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind prior to 2.7.9.4,
 2.8.11.2, and 2.9.6. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for
 a specific property), the service has the Oracle JDBC jar in the classpath,
 and an attacker can provide an LDAP service to access, it is possible to
 make the service execute a malicious payload.
