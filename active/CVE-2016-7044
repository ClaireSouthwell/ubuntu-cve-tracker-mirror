 https://github.com/irssi/irssi/releases/tag/0.8.20
Description: 
 The unformat_24bit_color() function is called by format_send_to_gui()
 to decode 24bit color codes into their components. The pointer is
 advanced unconditionally without checking if a complete code was
 supplied.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Gabriel Campana and Adrien Guinet discovered that the format parsing
 code in Irssi did not properly verify 24bit color codes. A remote
 attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application
 crash).
