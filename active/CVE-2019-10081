Description:
 HTTP/2 (2.4.20 through 2.4.39) very early pushes, for example configured
 with "H2PushResource", could lead to an overwrite of memory in the pushing
 request's pool, leading to crashes. The memory copied is that of the
 configured push link header values, not data supplied by the client.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sbeattie> MITIGATION: Unpatched servers can disable HTTP/2 push with
   the "H2Push off" directive.
 sbeattie> apache 2.4.20 and newer
