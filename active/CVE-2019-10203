Description:
 An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing an
 authorized user to cause the server to exit by inserting a crafted record in a
 MASTER type zone under their control. The issue is due to the fact that the
 Authoritative Server will exit when it tries to store the notified serial in
 the PostgreSQL database, if this serial cannot be represented in 31 bits.
