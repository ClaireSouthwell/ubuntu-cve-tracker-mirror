Description: 
 An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.25. Incorrect
 "restoration of privilege" checking when running out of stack during
 exception handling could be used by attackers able to supply crafted
 PostScript to execute code using the "pipe" instruction. This is due to an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2018-16509.
