Description: 
 When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
 integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
 ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
 causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
 tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
 attack.
