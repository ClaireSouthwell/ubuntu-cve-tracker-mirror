Description:
 An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka
 libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. There is a heap-based buffer
 over-read in _bfd_doprnt in bfd.c because elf_object_p in elfcode.h
 mishandles an e_shstrndx section of type SHT_GROUP by omitting a trailing
 '\0' character.
