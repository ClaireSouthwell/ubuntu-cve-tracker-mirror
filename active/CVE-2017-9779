Description:
 OCaml compiler allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown
 vectors, a similar issue to CVE-2017-9772 "but with much less impact."
 By default, it seems the environment variables CAML_CPLUGINS,
 CAML_NATIVE_CPLUGINS, and CAML_BYTE_CPLUGINS can be used to auto-load code
 into any executable produced with ocamlopt or ocamlc. This can lead to
 privilege escalation if the binary is marked setuid.
