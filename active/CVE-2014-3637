Description: 
 By attaching the file descriptor of a D-Bus connection to a D-Bus
 message and sending that message via the dbus-daemon, a malicious
 process can create D-Bus connections that persist after the process that
 created them has terminated. This exacerbates various patterns of
 undesirable/abusive behaviour by making it impossible to terminate them
 by killing processes.
