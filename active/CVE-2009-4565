 http://www.sendmail.org/releases/8.14.4
Description:
 sendmail before 8.14.4 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a
 Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which (1) allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL-based SMTP servers via a
 crafted server certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority,
 and (2) allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via
 a crafted client certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
 Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
