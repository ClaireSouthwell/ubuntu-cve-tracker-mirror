Description:
 The png_load function in lib/png.c in SWFTools 0.9.2 does not properly
 validate a multiplication of width and bits-per-pixel values, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read
 and application crash) via a crafted file, as demonstrated by an erroneous
 png_load call that occurs because of incorrect integer data types in
 png2swf.
