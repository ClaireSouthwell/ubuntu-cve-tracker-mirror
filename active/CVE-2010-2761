Description:
 The multipart_init function in (1) CGI.pm before 3.50 and (2) Simple.pm in
 CGI::Simple 1.112 and earlier uses a hardcoded value of the MIME boundary
 string in multipart/x-mixed-replace content, which allows remote attackers
 to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting
 attacks via crafted input that contains this value, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2010-3172.
