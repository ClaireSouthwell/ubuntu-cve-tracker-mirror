Description:
 A code injection issue was discovered in PyXDG before 0.26 via crafted
 Python code in a Category element of a Menu XML document in a .menu file.
 XDG_CONFIG_DIRS must be set up to trigger xdg.Menu.parse parsing within the
 directory containing this file. This is due to a lack of sanitization in
 xdg/Menu.py before an eval call.
