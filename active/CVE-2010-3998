Description:
 The (1) banshee-1 and (2) muinshee scripts in Banshee 1.8.0 and earlier
 place a zero-length directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows
 local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse shared library in the
 current working directory.  NOTE: Banshee might also be affected using
 GST_PLUGIN_PATH.
