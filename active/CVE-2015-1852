Description:
 The s3_token middleware in OpenStack keystonemiddleware before 1.6.0 and
 python-keystoneclient before 1.4.0 disables certification verification when
 the "insecure" option is set in a paste configuration (paste.ini) file
 regardless of the value, which allows remote attackers to conduct
 man-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted certificate, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2014-7144.
