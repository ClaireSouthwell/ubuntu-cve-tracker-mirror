Description:
 The ressol function implements the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for finding
 square roots could be sent into a nearly infinite loop due to a misplaced
 conditional check. This could occur if a composite modulus is provided,
 as this algorithm is only defined for primes. This function is exposed
 to attacker controlled input via the OS2ECP function during ECC point
 decompression.
