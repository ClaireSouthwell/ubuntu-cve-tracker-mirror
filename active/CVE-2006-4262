Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in cscope 15.5 and earlier allow user-assisted
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via multiple vectors including (1) a long pathname that is
 not properly handled during file list parsing, (2) long pathnames that
 result from path variable expansion such as tilde expansion for the HOME
 environment variable, and (3) a long -f (aka reffile) command line
 argument.
