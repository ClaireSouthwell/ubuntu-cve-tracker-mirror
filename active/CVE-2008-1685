Description:
 gcc 4.2.0 through 4.3.0 in GNU Compiler Collection, when casts are not
 used, considers the sum of a pointer and an int to be greater than or equal
 to the pointer, which might remove length testing code that was intended as
 a protection mechanism against integer overflow and buffer overflow
 attacks.

Notes:
 jdstrand> gcc-4.3 exists in main, so watch for Intrepid and later
