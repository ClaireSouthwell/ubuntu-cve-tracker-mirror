Description:
 When accessing a directory protected by a security constraint with a URL
 that did not end in a slash, Tomcat would redirect to the URL with the
 trailing slash thereby confirming the presence of the directory before
 processing the security constraint. It was therefore possible for a user
 to determine if a directory existed or not, even if the user was not
 permitted to view the directory. The issue also occurred at the root of
 a web application in which case the presence of the web application was
 confirmed, even if a user did not have access.
