Description:
 Condor installations that rely solely upon host-based authentication were
 vulnerable to an attacker who controls an IP, its reverse-DNS entry and has
 knowledge of a target site's security configuration. With this control and
 knowledge, the attacker could bypass the target site's host-based
 authentication and be authorized to perform privileged actions (i.e.
 actions requiring ALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR or ALLOW_WRITE). Condor deployments
 using host-based authentication that contain no hostnames (IPs or IP globs
 only) or use authentication stronger than host-based are not vulnerable.
