Description: 
 This sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length
 header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater
 headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep
 the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess
 memory, potentially leading to a Denial-of-Service. Also known as "HTTP/2
 0-Length Headers Leak"
