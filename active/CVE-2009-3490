Description:
 GNU Wget before 1.12 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain
 name in the Common Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle remote attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a
 crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a
 related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
