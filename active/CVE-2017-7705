Description:
 In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11, the RPC over RDMA
 dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or
 a malformed capture file. This was addressed in
 epan/dissectors/packet-rpcrdma.c by correctly checking for going beyond the
 maximum offset.
