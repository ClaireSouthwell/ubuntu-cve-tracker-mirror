Description:
 xine-lib 1.1.12, and other versions before 1.1.15, does not check for
 failure of malloc in circumstances including (1) the mymng_process_header
 function in demux_mng.c, (2) the open_mod_file function in demux_mod.c, and
 (3) frame_buffer allocation in the real_parse_audio_specific_data function
 in demux_real.c, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted media file.
