Description:
 An attacker with enough privileges to change the hostname might be able to
 disclose uninitialized memory. This issue also affects the Authoritative
 Server and dnsdist; since the attack requires very high privileges and the
 issue does not affect Linux, we will not be releasing new versions for
 those just for this issue. Severity is low.
