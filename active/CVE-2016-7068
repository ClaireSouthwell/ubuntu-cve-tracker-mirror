Description:
 Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that pdns-recursor parses
 all records present in a query regardless of whether they are needed
 or even legitimate, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to
 cause an abnormal CPU usage load on the pdns server, resulting in
 a partial denial of service if the system becomes overloaded.
