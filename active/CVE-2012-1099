Description:
 A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way 'select' helper method
 of the Ruby on Rails performed HTML escaping of 'select' HTML tag options, when
 the tags were created manually. In this case, the select tag values might end
 up unescaped. A remote-attacker could provide a specially-crafted input to Ruby
 on Rails application, using select tags this way, which potentially resulted
 into arbitrary HTML or webscript execution.
