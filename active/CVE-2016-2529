Description:
 The iseries_check_file_type function in wiretap/iseries.c in the iSeries
 file parser in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not consider that a line
 may lack the "OBJECT PROTOCOL" substring, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a
 crafted file.
