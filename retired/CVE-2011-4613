Description: 
 On Debian systems, the X wrapper (/usr/bin/X) is a setuid-root binary that
 checks for some security requirements before launching Xorg with root
 privileges. By default, the wrapper's configuration file only allows users
 whose controlling TTY (console) to start the X server, but it is possible to
 bypass this restriction by connecting another file (with similar tty
 properties) to standard input before launching the X wrapper.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> requires pty access. In combination with CVE-2011-4029 this becomes
  more important, but that CVE is fixed in Ubuntu.
 mdeslaur> Debian fixed this by dropping support for alternate TTY devices,
 mdeslaur> which we need for upstart support. See changelog for
 mdeslaur> (1:7.4~2ubuntu2) and (1:7.4~4).
