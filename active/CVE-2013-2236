Description:
 Quagga OSPF-API stack overrun
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> requires --enable-opaque-lsa during the build (true for Ubuntu
  10.04 LTS and higher)
 jdstrand> also requires starting ospfd with '-a'. ospfd is not enabled by
  default and the configuration in /etc/quagga/debian.conf does not include
  '-a'. Per upstream, normal protection measures (eg, packet filtering,
  listening on internal network, etc) would prevent this. Furthermore, it is
  difficult to exploit. Considering the above, downgrading to 'low'
