Description:
 Previously, an authenticated user could cause the master to execute
 YAML.load on user-specified input, as well as MessagePack.unpack if the
 msgpack gem was installed.
 Since 3.2.2, agents have always sent facts as PSON. There is no reason
 to support other formats, so reject all fact formats except PSON.
