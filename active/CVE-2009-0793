Description:
 cmsxform.c in LittleCMS (aka lcms or liblcms) 1.18, as used in OpenJDK and
 other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
 pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted image that
 triggers execution of incorrect code for "transformations of monochrome
 profiles."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> as per upstream post to lcms-user:
 mdeslaur> No code injection can be done using this bug. Using monochrome
 mdeslaur> profiles is rare, and using  them in the output direction is a
 mdeslaur> corner case. This bug is only exploitable if the application
 mdeslaur> uses monochrome output, and then the crafted profile should be
 mdeslaur> in the output direction. Does not affect input profiles, so an
 mdeslaur> attacker could NOT use this flaw by creating a specially-crafted
 mdeslaur> image.
