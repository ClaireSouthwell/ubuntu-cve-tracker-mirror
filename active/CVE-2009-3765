Description:
 mutt_ssl.c in mutt 1.5.19 and 1.5.20, when OpenSSL is used, does not
 properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common
 Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued
 by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
