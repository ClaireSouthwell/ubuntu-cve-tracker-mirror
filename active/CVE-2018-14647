Description:
 Python's elementtree C accelerator failed to initialise Expat's hash salt
 during initialization. This could make it easy to conduct denial of service
 attacks against Expat by constructing an XML document that would cause
 pathological hash collisions in Expat's internal data structures, consuming
 large amounts CPU and RAM. Python 3.8, 3.7, 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 2.7 are believed
 to be vulnerable.
