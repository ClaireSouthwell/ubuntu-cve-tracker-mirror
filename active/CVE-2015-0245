Description:
 D-Bus 1.4.x through 1.6.x before 1.6.30, 1.8.x before 1.8.16, and 1.9.x
 before 1.9.10 does not validate the source of ActivationFailure signals,
 which allows local users to cause a denial of service (activation failure
 error returned) by leveraging a race condition involving sending an
 ActivationFailure signal before systemd responds.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> The policy change is recommended for stable use, though the
  code-based changes were made for platforms where uid==0 may not be
  omnipotent -- we should probably use both in our packages, or at least
  both for the versions with distro-patched AppArmor support.
