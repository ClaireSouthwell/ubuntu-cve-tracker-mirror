Description:
 ActionScript in Adobe Flash Player 9.0.124.0 and earlier does not require
 user interaction in conjunction with (1) the FileReference.browse operation
 in the FileReference upload API or (2) the FileReference.download operation
 in the FileReference download API, which allows remote attackers to create
 a browse dialog box, and possibly have unspecified other impact, via an SWF
 file.
