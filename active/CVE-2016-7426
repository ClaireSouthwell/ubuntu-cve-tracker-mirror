Description:
 When ntpd is configured with rate limiting for all associations (restrict
 default limited in ntp.conf), the limits are applied also to responses
 received from its configured sources. An attacker who knows the sources
 (e.g., from an IPv4 refid in server response) and knows the system is
 (mis)configured in this way can periodically send packets with spoofed
 source address to keep the rate limiting activated and prevent ntpd from
 accepting valid responses from its sources.
