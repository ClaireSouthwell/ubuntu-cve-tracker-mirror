Description:
 It was found that JGroups did not require necessary headers for encrypt
 and auth protocols from new nodes joining the cluster. An attacker could
 use this flaw to bypass security restrictions, and use this vulnerability
 to send and receive messages within the cluster, leading to information
 disclosure, message spoofing, or further possible attacks.
