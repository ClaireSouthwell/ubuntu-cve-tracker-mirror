Description:
 The PartsBatch class in Pan 0.132 and earlier does not properly manage the
 data structures for Parts batches, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
 via a crafted .nzb file that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
