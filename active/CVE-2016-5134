Description:
 net/proxy/proxy_service.cc in the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Google
 Chrome before 52.0.2743.82 does not ensure that URL information is
 restricted to a scheme, host, and port, which allows remote attackers to
 discover credentials by operating a server with a PAC script, a related
 issue to CVE-2016-3763.
