Description:
 The dba_replace function in PHP 5.2.6 and 4.x allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (file truncation) via a key with the
 NULL byte.  NOTE: this might only be a vulnerability in limited
 circumstances in which the attacker can modify or add database entries but
 does not have permissions to truncate the file.
