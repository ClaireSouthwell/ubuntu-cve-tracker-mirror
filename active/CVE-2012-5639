 Remote file inclusion by office applications
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> seems more like a feature request. LibreOffice prompts the user
  saying that the document contains links to external data and asks if the user
  wants to refresh them. The prompt does not say what the files are. The
  external content is fetched the first time without prompting.
