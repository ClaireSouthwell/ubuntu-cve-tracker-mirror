Description:
 QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the ColdFire Fast Ethernet Controller
 emulator support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur
 while receiving packets in 'mcf_fec_receive'. A privileged user/process
 inside guest could use this issue to crash the QEMU process on the host
 leading to DoS.
