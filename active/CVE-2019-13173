Description:
 fstream before 1.0.12 is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite. Extracting
 tarballs containing a hardlink to a file that already exists in the system,
 and a file that matches the hardlink, will overwrite the system's file with
 the contents of the extracted file. The fstream.DirWriter() function is
 vulnerable.
