Description:
 The vm_map_lookup function in sys/vm/vm_map.c in the mmap implementation in
 the kernel in FreeBSD 9.0 through 9.1-RELEASE-p4 does not properly
 determine whether a task should have write access to a memory location,
 which allows local users to bypass filesystem write permissions and
 consequently gain privileges via a crafted application that leverages read
 permissions, and makes mmap and ptrace system calls.
