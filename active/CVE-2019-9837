Description:
 Doorkeeper::OpenidConnect (aka the OpenID Connect extension for Doorkeeper)
 1.4.x and 1.5.x before 1.5.4 has an open redirect via the redirect_uri
 field in an OAuth authorization request (that results in an error response)
 with the 'openid' scope and a prompt=none value. This allows phishing
 attacks against the authorization flow.
