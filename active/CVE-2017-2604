Description:
 Administrative monitors are warnings about the system state shown to
 Jenkins admins. They sometimes provide actions to e.g. automatically
 address the reported problem, or disable the warning. These actions
 were not consistently protected by permission checks, thereby allowing
 low privilege users to act on them.

 All administrative monitors now require the user accessing them to be
 an administrator.
