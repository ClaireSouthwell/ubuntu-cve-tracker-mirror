Description:
 Perl before 5.30.3 has an integer overflow related to mishandling of a
 "PL_regkind[OP(n)] == NOTHING" situation. A crafted regular expression
 could lead to malformed bytecode with a possibility of instruction
 injection.

  An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if
  it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating
  regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the
  regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service
  attacks in this usage scenario.]
