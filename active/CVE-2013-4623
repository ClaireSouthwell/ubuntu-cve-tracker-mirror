Description:
 The x509parse_crt function in x509.h in PolarSSL 1.1.x before 1.1.7 and
 1.2.x before 1.2.8 does not properly parse certificate messages during the
 SSL/TLS handshake, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a certificate message that
 contains a PEM encoded certificate.
