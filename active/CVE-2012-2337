Description: 
 A security flaw was found in the way sudo granted access for particular host,
 when multiple netmask values have been used in sudo's Host / Host_List
 configuration. Such configuration allowed unprivileged users, who were
 authorized by the sudoers file to run their sudo commands, to run these
 commands from any host regardless of the Host_List configuration (even from
 hosts, which were intended according to the Host_List netmask configuration
 not to allow execution of such commands according to the netmask).
