Description: 
 Filebucket denial of service
 By constructing a marshaled form of a Puppet::FileBucket::File object a user
 can cause it it to be written to any place on the disk of the puppet master.
 This could be used for a denial of service attach against the puppet master if
 an attacker fills a filesystem that can cause systems to stop working. In order
 to do this the attacker needs no access to the puppet master system, but does
 need access to agent SSL keys.
