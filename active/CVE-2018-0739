Description: 
 Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in
 PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with
 excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are
 no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this
 is considered safe.
