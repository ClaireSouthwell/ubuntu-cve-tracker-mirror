Description:
 curl and libcurl between 7.52.0 and 7.53.1 do not prevent TLS
 session resumption when the client certificate has changed, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions by resuming
 a session.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled client certificates
 when resuming a TLS session. A remote attacker could use this to hijack
 a previously authenticated connection.
Notes:
 sbeattie> reported upstream mitigation:
  Set `CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE` to 0L when using client certificates
