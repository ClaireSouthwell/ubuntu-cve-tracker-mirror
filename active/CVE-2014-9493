Description:
 Vulnerability in Glance v2 API. By setting a malicious image location an
 authenticated user can download or delete any file on the Glance server for
 which the glance-api process user has access to. Only setups using the Glance
 v2 API are affected by this flaw.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Per upstream, "A potential mitigation strategy available for
  operators is to change the glance policy to restrict access to administrators
  for get_image_location, set_image_location, and delete_image_location."
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS not affected (does not have V2 API)
