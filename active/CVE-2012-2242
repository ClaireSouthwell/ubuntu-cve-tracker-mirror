Description:
 Raphael Geissert discovered that dget does not properly escape arguments to
 external commands when processing .dsc and .changes files, allowing an
 attacker to execute arbitrary code. This issue is limited with the fix for
 CVE-2012-2241, and had already been fixed in version 2.10.73 due to changes to
 the code, without considering its security implications.
