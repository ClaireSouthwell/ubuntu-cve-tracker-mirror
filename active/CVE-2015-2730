Description:
 Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.19.1, as used in Mozilla
 Firefox before 39.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.8 and 38.x before 38.1, and
 other products, does not properly perform Elliptical Curve Cryptography
 (ECC) multiplications, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof
 ECDSA signatures via unspecified vectors.
