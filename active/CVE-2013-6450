Description:
 The DTLS retransmission implementation in OpenSSL through 0.9.8y and 1.x
 through 1.0.1e does not properly maintain data structures for digest and
 encryption contexts, which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to
 trigger the use of a different context by interfering with packet delivery,
 related to ssl/d1_both.c and ssl/t1_enc.c.
