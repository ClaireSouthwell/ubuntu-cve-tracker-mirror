Description:
 strongSwan 4.3.0 through 5.x before 5.3.2 and strongSwan VPN Client before
 1.4.6, when using EAP or pre-shared keys for authenticating an IKEv2
 connection, does not enforce server authentication restrictions until the
 entire authentication process is complete, which allows remote servers to
 obtain credentials by using a valid certificate and then reading the
 responses.
