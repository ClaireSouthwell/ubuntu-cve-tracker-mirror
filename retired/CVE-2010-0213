Description:
 BIND 9.7.1 and 9.7.1-P1, when a recursive validating server has a trust
 anchor that is configured statically or via DNSSEC Lookaside Validation
 (DLV), allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop)
 via a query for an RRSIG record whose answer is not in the cache, which
 causes BIND to repeatedly send RRSIG queries to the authoritative servers.
