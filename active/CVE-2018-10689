Description:
 blktrace (aka Block IO Tracing) 1.2.0, as used with the Linux kernel and
 Android, has a buffer overflow in the dev_map_read function in btt/devmap.c
 because the device and devno arrays are too small, as demonstrated by an
 invalid free when using the btt program with a crafted file.
