Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.9. When handling a URN request, a
 corresponding HTTP request is made. This HTTP request doesn't go through
 the access checks that incoming HTTP requests go through. This causes all
 access checks to be bypassed and allows access to restricted HTTP servers,
 e.g., an attacker can connect to HTTP servers that only listen on
 localhost.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This was fixed in 4.x by rewriting the URI parser to use SBuf.
 mdeslaur> Backporting the 4.x commit to 3.x is problematic.
 mdeslaur> As of 2020-02-07, no backport to 3.x is available, and no
 mdeslaur> details or reproducer for the issue is available to develop a
 mdeslaur> specific fix for 3.x.
