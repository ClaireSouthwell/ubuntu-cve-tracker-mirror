 https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1712
Description:
 A floating point math calculation in ScaleAnyToQuantum() of
 /MagickCore/quantum-private.h could lead to undefined behavior in the form
 of a value outside the range of type unsigned long long. The flaw could be
 triggered by a crafted input file under certain conditions when it is
 processed by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low
 because although it could potentially lead to an impact to application
 availability, no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects
 ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
