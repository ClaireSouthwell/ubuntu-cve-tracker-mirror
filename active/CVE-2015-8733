Description:
 The ngsniffer_process_record function in wiretap/ngsniffer.c in the Sniffer
 file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does
 not validate the relationships between record lengths and record header
 lengths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted file.
