Candidate: CVE-2007-5162
References: 
Description: 
 The connect method in lib/net/http.rb in the (1) Net::HTTP and (2) Net::HTTPS
 libraries in Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 does not verify that the commonName (CN)
 field in a server certificate matches the domain name in an HTTPS request,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to intercept SSL transmissions via a
 man-in-the-middle attack or spoofed web site.
