Description:
 In PHP before 5.6.32, 7.x before 7.0.25, and 7.1.x before 7.1.11, an error
 in the date extension's timelib_meridian handling of 'front of' and 'back
 of' directives could be used by attackers able to supply date strings to
 leak information from the interpreter, related to ext/date/lib/parse_date.c
 out-of-bounds reads affecting the php_parse_date function. NOTE: this is a
 different issue than CVE-2017-11145.
