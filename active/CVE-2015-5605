Description:
 The regular-expression implementation in Google V8, as used in Google
 Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, mishandles interrupts, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted
 JavaScript code, as demonstrated by an error in garbage collection during
 allocation of a stack-overflow exception message.
