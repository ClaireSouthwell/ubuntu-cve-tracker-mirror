Description:
 vulnerability in expiry checks for PKI tokens in the Keystone authentication
 middleware. Expired tokens for authenticated users could continue to be used,
 potentially resulting in the bypass of intended security policies. The effect
 of PKI token revocation is also reversed when the token expires, in the sense
 that a revoked token is once again treated as being valid. Only setups using
 PKI tokens are affected.
