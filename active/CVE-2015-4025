Description:
 PHP before 5.4.41, 5.5.x before 5.5.25, and 5.6.x before 5.6.9 truncates a
 pathname upon encountering a \x00 character in certain situations, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and
 access files or directories with unexpected names via a crafted argument to
 (1) set_include_path, (2) tempnam, (3) rmdir, or (4) readlink.  NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.
