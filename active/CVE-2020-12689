Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0.
 Any user authenticated within a limited scope (trust/oauth/application
 credential) can create an EC2 credential with an escalated permission, such
 as obtaining admin while the user is on a limited viewer role. This
 potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project
 another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user
 global admin privileges.
