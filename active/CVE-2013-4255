Description:
 A denial of service flaw was found in the way Condor's policy definition
 evaluator processed certain policy definitions. If an administrator used an
 attribute defined on a job in any of the following condor_startd policies
 (CONTINUE, KILL, PREEMPT, SUSPEND), a remote Condor service user could use
 this flaw to cause a denial of the condor_startd service by submitting a
 Condor job that caused certain policy definition to be evaluated to either
 ERROR or UNDEFINED states.
