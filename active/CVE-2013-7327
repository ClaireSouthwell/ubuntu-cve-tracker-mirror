Description:
 The gdImageCrop function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP 5.5.x before 5.5.9 does not
 check return values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
 invalid imagecrop arguments that lead to use of a NULL pointer as a return
 value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-7226.
