Description:
 Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.130, does not properly
 restrict the creation context during creation of a DOM wrapper, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via crafted
 JavaScript code that uses a Blink public API, related to
 WebArrayBufferConverter.cpp, WebBlob.cpp, WebDOMError.cpp, and
 WebDOMFileSystem.cpp.
