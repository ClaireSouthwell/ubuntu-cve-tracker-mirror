Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE
 (component: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
 7u261, 8u251, 11.0.7 and 14.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u251. Difficult to
 exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access
 via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
 attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and
 while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may
 significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
 vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note:
 This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
 running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets,
 that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet)
 and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not
 apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only
 trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base
 Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS
 Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
