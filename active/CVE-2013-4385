Description:
 If given a buffer and #f (the Scheme value for "false") as the buffer's
 size (which should trigger automatic size detection but doesn't),
 read-string! will read beyond the buffer, until the input port (file,
 socket, etc) is exhausted. This may result in the typical potential
 remote code execution or denial of service; in CHICKEN, these buffers
 are initially allocated on the stack and moved to the heap upon GC.
