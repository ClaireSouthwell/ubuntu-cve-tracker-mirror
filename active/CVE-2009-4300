Description:
 Multiple unspecified authentication plugins in Moodle 1.8 before 1.8.11 and
 1.9 before 1.9.7 store the MD5 hashes for passwords in the user table, even
 when the cached hashes are not used by the plugin, which might make it
 easier for attackers to obtain credentials via unspecified vectors.
