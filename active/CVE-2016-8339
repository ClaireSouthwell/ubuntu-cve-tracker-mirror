Description:
 A buffer overflow in Redis 3.2.x prior to 3.2.4 causes arbitrary code
 execution when a crafted command is sent. An out of bounds write
 vulnerability exists in the handling of the client-output-buffer-limit
 option during the CONFIG SET command for the Redis data structure store. A
 crafted CONFIG SET command can lead to an out of bounds write potentially
 resulting in code execution.
