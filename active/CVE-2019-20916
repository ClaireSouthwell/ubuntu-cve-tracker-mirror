Description:
 The pip package before 19.2 for Python allows Directory Traversal when a
 URL is given in an install command, because a Content-Disposition header
 can have ../ in a filename, as demonstrated by overwriting the
 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file. This occurs in _download_http_url in
 _internal/download.py.
