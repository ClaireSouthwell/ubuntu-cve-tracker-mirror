Description: 
 ddos amplification issue in when udp is enabled in memcached
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that Memcached listened to UDP by default. A remote
 attacker could use this as part of a distributed denial of service
 attack.
Notes: 
 sbeattie> in Ubuntu (and Debian) memcached is bound to the loppback
   interface by default. However, if memcached is bound to other
   interfaces, the UDP port is still enabled by default.
 sbeattie> Ubuntu update is to disable listening on UDP by default. To
   re-enable UDP, add '-U 11211' to /etc/memcached.conf and restart the
   memcahced service.
