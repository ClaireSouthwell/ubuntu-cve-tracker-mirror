Description:
 libtasn1 "asn1_get_length_der()" DER decoding issue
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per Simon Josefsson (upstream), asn1_get_length_der() does not
  itself have the vulnerability, but that callers wouldn't check its return
  code which could cause a DoS. It was deemed easier for asn1_get_length_der()
  to throw an error rather than changing all callers.
 jdstrand> I am performing an archive grep for asn1_get_length_der
