Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)
 interfaces for PHP through 7.1.4 allow attackers to cause a denial of
 service (memory consumption and application crash) via operations on long
 strings. NOTE: the vendor disputes this, stating "There is no security
 issue here, because GMP safely aborts in case of an OOM condition. The only
 attack vector here is denial of service. However, if you allow
 attacker-controlled, unbounded allocations you have a DoS vector regardless
 of GMP's OOM behavior."
