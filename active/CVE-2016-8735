Description:
 The JmxRemoteLifecycleListener was not updated to take account of
 Oracle's fix for CVE-2016-3427. Therefore, Tomcat installations using
 this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote code execution
 vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important rather than
 critical due to the small number of installations using this listener and
 that it would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be accessible to an
 attacker even when the listener is used.
