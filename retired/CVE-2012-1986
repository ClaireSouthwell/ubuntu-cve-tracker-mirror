Description: 
 Filebucket arbitrary file read
 It is possible to construct a REST request to fetch a file from a filebucket
 that overrides the puppet masterâ€™s defined location for the files to be stored.
 If a user has access to construct directories and symlinks on the machine they
 can read any file that the user the puppet master is running as has access to.
