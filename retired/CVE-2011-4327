Description: 
 On hosts that did not have a randomness source configured in
 OpenSSL and were not configured to use EGD/PRNGd (using the
 --with-prngd-socket configure option), the ssh-rand-helper command
 was being implicitly executed by ssh-keysign with open file
 descriptors to the host private keys. An attacker could use
 ptrace(2) to attach to ssh-rand-helper and exfiltrate the keys.
