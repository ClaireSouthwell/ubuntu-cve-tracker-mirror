Description:
 The unparse implementation in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT
 Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.6.x through 1.9, when an LDAP backend is used,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (file descriptor
 exhaustion and daemon hang) via a principal name that triggers use of a
 backslash escape sequence, as demonstrated by a \n sequence.
