Description:
 WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-reset
 e-mail message, which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to
 reset arbitrary passwords by making a crafted
 wp-login.php?action=lostpassword request and then arranging for this e-mail
 to bounce or be resent, leading to transmission of the reset key to a
 mailbox on an attacker-controlled SMTP server. This is related to
 problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in
 conjunction with the PHP mail function.
