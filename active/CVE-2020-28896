Description:
 Mutt before 2.0.2 and NeoMutt before 2020-11-20 did not ensure that
 $ssl_force_tls was processed if an IMAP server's initial server response
 was invalid. The connection was not properly closed, and the code could
 continue attempting to authenticate. This could result in authentication
 credentials being exposed on an unencrypted connection, or to a
 machine-in-the-middle.
