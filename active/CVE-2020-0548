Description: 
 On some processors, under certain microarchitectural conditions
 involving a vector operation executing after a period of time where
 no vector operations executed, partial data values previously read
 from a vector register on a physical core may be propagated into
 unused portions of the store buffer. On processors affected by
 Microarchitectural Data Samping (MDS) or Transactional Asynchronous
 Abort (TAA), data from a store buffer entry may be inferred using
 one of these data sampling side channel methods. Using the MDS or
 TAA methods, itmay be possible for malicious actors to infer data
 values from previously read vector registers.  The vector register
 sampling method is not believed to affect processors that are not
 affected by MDS or TAA.
