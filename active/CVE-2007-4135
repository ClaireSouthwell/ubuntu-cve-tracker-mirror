Candidate: CVE-2007-4135
References: 
Description: 
 The NFSv4 ID mapper (nfsidmap) before 0.17 does not properly handle return
 values from the getpwnam_r function when performing a username lookup, which
 can cause it to report a file as being owned by "root" instead of "nobody" if
 the file exists on the server but not on the client.
