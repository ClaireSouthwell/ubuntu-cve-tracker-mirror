Description:
 SystemTap 1.4 and earlier, when unprivileged (aka stapusr) mode is enabled,
 allows local users to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and
 OOPS) via a crafted ELF program with DWARF expressions that are not
 properly handled by a stap script that performs context variable access.
