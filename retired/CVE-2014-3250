Description:
 In Apache 2.4, SSLCARevocationCheck directive was added to mod_ssl,
 which defaults it to none and must be explicitly configured. This
 setting enables checking of a certificate revocation list. The default
 Puppet master vhost config shipped with Puppet does not include this
 setting. If a Puppet master is set up to run with Apache 2.4, and this
 default vhost configuration file is used, the Puppet master will
 continue to honor a host's certificate even after it is revoked.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> triggered under apache 2.4 only
 mdeslaur> later Debian packages don't enable SSLCARevocationCheck by
 mdeslaur> default, just simply add it as a commented-out example to the
 mdeslaur> config file. We are not going to fix this in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
 mdeslaur> If this is required, it can simply be added to the local
 mdeslaur> configuration.
