Description:
 extensions/renderer/render_frame_observer_natives.cc in Google Chrome
 before 49.0.2623.75 does not properly consider object lifetimes and
 re-entrancy issues during OnDocumentElementCreated handling, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.
