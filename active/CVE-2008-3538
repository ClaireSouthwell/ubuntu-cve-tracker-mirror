Description:
 libxml2, possibly before 2.5.0, does not properly detect recursion during
 entity expansion, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
 denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document
 containing a large number of nested entity references, aka the "billion
 laughs attack."
