Description:
 The SMB (aka Samba) subsystem in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.8, when Windows File
 Sharing is enabled, does not properly handle errors in resolving pathnames,
 which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended sharing
 restrictions, and read, create, or modify files, in certain circumstances
 involving user accounts that lack home directories.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> from Apple's security announce: "An unchecked error condition exists
  in Samba. A user who does not have a configured home directory, and connects
  to the Windows File Sharing service, will be able to access the contents of
  the file system, subject to local file system permissions. This update
  addresses the issue by improving the handling of path resolution errors."
