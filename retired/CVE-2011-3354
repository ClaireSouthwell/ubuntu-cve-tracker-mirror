Description:
 CtcpParser::packedReply in src/core/ctcpparser.cpp in Quassel does not process
 certain CTCP requests correctly, allowing a remote attacker connected to the
 same IRC network as the victim to cause a Denial of Service condition by
 sending specially crafted CTCP requests. This was demonstrated in various
 exploits on freenode today.
