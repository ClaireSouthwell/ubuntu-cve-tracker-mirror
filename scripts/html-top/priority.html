<tr><th>Priority</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr>
 <td class="released">Not Vulnerable</td>
 <td class="desc">
  Packages which do not exist (DNE) in the archive, are not
  affected by the vulnerability or have a fix applied in the
  archive.
 </td>

<tr>
 <td class="pending">Pending</td>
 <td class="desc">
  A fix has been applied and updated packages are awaiting
  arrival into the archive. This often used when a package
  is received into -proposed for wider testing.

<tr class="untriaged">
 <td class="needed">Unknown</td>
 <td class="desc">
  Open vulnerability where the priority is currently unknown and needs to be
  triaged.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="negligible">
 <td class="needed">Negligible</td>
 <td class="desc">
  Open vulnerability that is technically a security problem, but is only
  theoretical in nature, requires a very special situation, has almost no install
  base, or does no real damage.  These tend not to get backported from upstream,
  and will likely not be included in security updates unless there is an easy fix
  and some other issue causes an update.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="low">
 <td class="needed">Low</td>
 <td class="desc">
  Open vulnerability that is a security problem, but is hard to exploit due to
  environment, requires a user-assisted attack, a small install base, or does
  very little damage.  These tend to be included in security updates only when
  higher priority issues require an update, or if many low priority issues have
  built up.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="medium">
 <td class="needed">Medium</td>
 <td class="desc">
  Open vulnerability that is a real security problem, and is exploitable for
  many people.  Includes network daemon denial of service attacks, and gaining
  user privileges.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="high">
 <td class="needed">High</td>
 <td class="desc">
  Open vulnerability that is a real problem, exploitable for many people in a
  default installation. Includes serious remote denial of services, local root
  privilege escalations, or data loss.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="critical">
 <td class="needed">Critical</td>
 <td class="desc">
  Open vulnerability that is a world-burning problem, exploitable for nearly
  all people in a default installation. Includes remote root privilege
  escalations, or massive data loss.
 </td>
</tr>

<p>
Note that these priority levels may differ from other published severity levels
(like CVSS as used in the <a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability
Database</a>). The priorities assigned to vulnerabilities in Ubuntu are for
prioritizing the work of when CVEs will be fixed as opposed to just an
assessment of importance or risk. The priority is based on several factors,
including the risk, importance, install base, and any other factors which may
lessen the impact of certain vulnerabilities such as specific <a

features</a> security features or uncommon configuration.
