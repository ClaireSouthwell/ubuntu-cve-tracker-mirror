Description:
 ext/intl/msgformat/msgformat_format.c in PHP before 5.6.26 and 7.x before
 7.0.11 does not properly restrict the locale length provided to the Locale
 class in the ICU library, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
 via a MessageFormatter::formatMessage call with a long first argument.
