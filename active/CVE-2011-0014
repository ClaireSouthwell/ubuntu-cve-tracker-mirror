Description:
 ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8h through 0.9.8q and 1.0.0 through 1.0.0c
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash), and possibly
 obtain sensitive information in applications that use OpenSSL, via a
 malformed ClientHello handshake message that triggers an out-of-bounds
 memory access, aka "OCSP stapling vulnerability."
