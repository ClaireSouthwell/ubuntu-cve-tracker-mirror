Description:
 Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in
 editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors/php/connector.php in
 FCKeditor 2.2, as used in Falt4 CMS, Nuke ET, and other products, allows
 remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by creating a file with PHP
 sequences preceded by a ZIP header, uploading this file via a FileUpload
 action with the application/zip content type, and then accessing this file
 via a direct request to the file in UserFiles/File/, probably a related
 issue to CVE-2005-4094.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
 third party information.
