Description:
 It was reported that python-elixir, a library for ORM mapping on
 top of SQLAlchemy with support for encrypting data stored in a
 database, suffers from weak use of cryptography.  It uses Blowfish
 in CFB mode, which has an additional parameter (IV), which is not
 specified and thus defaults to zero.  CFB mode is only secure if
 the the IV is unpredictable and different for every message.
 Because of this, and because the encryption key is shared for each
 database table (fields and rows), the same plaintext prefix is
 always encrypted to an identical and corresponding ciphertext
 prefix.  As a result, an attacker with access to the database could
 figure out the plaintext values of encrypted text.
