Description:
 Python-RSA 4.0 ignores leading '\0' bytes during decryption of ciphertext.
 This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an
 attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of
 accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as by causing
 excessive memory allocation).
