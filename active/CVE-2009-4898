Description:
 Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in TWiki before 4.3.2
 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users for
 requests that update pages, as demonstrated by a URL for a save script in
 the ACTION attribute of a FORM element, in conjunction with a call to the
 submit method in the onload attribute of a BODY element.  NOTE: this issue
 exists because of an insufficient fix for CVE-2009-1339.
