Description:
 epan/dissectors/packet-ppp.c in the PPP dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before
 1.8.3 uses incorrect OUI data structures during the decoding of (1) PPP and
 (2) LCP data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (assertion failure and application exit) via a malformed packet.
