Description:
 The x86 emulator in KVM 83, when a guest is configured for Symmetric
 Multiprocessing (SMP), does not use the Current Privilege Level (CPL) and
 I/O Privilege Level (IOPL) to restrict instruction execution, which allows
 guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or gain
 privileges on the guest OS by leveraging access to a (1) IO port or (2)
 MMIO region, and replacing an instruction in between emulator entry and
 instruction fetch, a related issue to CVE-2010-0298.
