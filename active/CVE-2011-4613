Description: 
 On Debian systems, the X wrapper (/usr/bin/X) is a setuid-root binary that
 checks for some security requirements before launching Xorg with root
 privileges. By default, the wrapper's configuration file only allows users
 whose controlling TTY (console) to start the X server, but it is possible to
 bypass this restriction by connecting another file (with similar tty
 properties) to standard input before launching the X wrapper.
