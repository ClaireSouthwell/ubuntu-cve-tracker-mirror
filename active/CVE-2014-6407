Description:
 The Docker engine, up to and including version 1.3.1, was vulnerable to
 extracting files to arbitrary paths on the host during ‘docker pull’
 and ‘docker load’ operations. This was caused by symlink and hardlink
 traversals present in Docker's image extraction. This vulnerability could
 be leveraged to perform remote code execution and privilege escalation.
