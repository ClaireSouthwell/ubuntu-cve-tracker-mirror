Description:
 The process_chpw_request function in schpw.c in the password-changing
 functionality in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.7 through 1.9 frees
 an invalid pointer, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
 or cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted request that
 triggers an error condition.
