Candidate: CVE-2019-3844

Description:
 It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can
 get new privileges through the execution of SUID binaries, which would
 allow to create binaries owned by the service transient group with the
 setgid bit set. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that
 will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the
 GID will be recycled.
