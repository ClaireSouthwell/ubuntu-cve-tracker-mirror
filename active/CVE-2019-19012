 https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/164
 https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/releases/tag/v6.9.4_rc2
Description:
 An integer overflow in the search_in_range function in regexec.c in
 Oniguruma 6.x before 6.9.4_rc2 leads to an out-of-bounds read, in which the
 offset of this read is under the control of an attacker. (This only affects
 the 32-bit compiled version). Remote attackers can cause a
 denial-of-service or information disclosure, or possibly have unspecified
 other impact, via a crafted regular expression.
