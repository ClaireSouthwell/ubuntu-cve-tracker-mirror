Description:
 PHP 4.4.4, 5.1.6, and other versions, when running on Apache, allows local
 users to modify behavior of other sites hosted on the same web server by
 modifying the mbstring.func_overload setting within .htaccess, which causes
 this setting to be applied to other virtual hosts on the same server.
