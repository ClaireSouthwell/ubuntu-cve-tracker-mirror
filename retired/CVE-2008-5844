Description:
 PHP 5.2.7 contains an incorrect change to the FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW
 functionality, and unintentionally disables magic_quotes_gpc regardless of
 the actual magic_quotes_gpc setting, which might make it easier for
 context-dependent attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks and
 unspecified other attacks.
