Description:
 The TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function in LibTIFF 3.9.0 and 3.9.2, as used in
 ImageMagick, does not properly handle invalid ReferenceBlackWhite values,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) via a crafted TIFF image that triggers an array index error, related
 to "downsampled OJPEG input."
