Description: 
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF
 image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of
 functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format
 files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF
 document file, when not properly initialized T2P context struct pointer
 has been provided by tiff2pdf (application requesting the conversion)
 as one of parameters for the routine performing the write. A remote
 attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that
 when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash or,
 potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
 running the tiff2pdf binary.
