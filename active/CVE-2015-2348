 http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php
Description:
 The move_uploaded_file implementation in ext/standard/basic_functions.c in
 PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 truncates a
 pathname upon encountering a \x00 character, which allows remote attackers
 to bypass intended extension restrictions and create files with unexpected
 names via a crafted second argument.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.
