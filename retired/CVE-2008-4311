Description:
 The default configuration of system.conf in D-Bus (aka DBus) before 1.2.6
 omits the send_type attribute in certain rules, which allows local users to
 bypass intended access restrictions by (1) sending messages, related to
 send_requested_reply; and possibly (2) receiving messages, related to
 receive_requested_reply.
