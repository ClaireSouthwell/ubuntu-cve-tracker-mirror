Description:
 The UNIX pipe which sudo uses to contact SSSD and read the available sudo
 rules from SSSD has too wide permissions, which means that anyone who can
 send a message using the same raw protocol that sudo and SSSD use can read
 the sudo rules available for any user. This affects versions of SSSD before
 1.16.3.
