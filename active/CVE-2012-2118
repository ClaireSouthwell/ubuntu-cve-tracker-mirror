 in X.Org X11 1.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in an input device
 name.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Reducing priority because we build with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and
  as of USN-1396-1, Ubuntu's glibc is patched to fix (CVE-2012-0864), so this
  is reduced to a denial of service.
 jdstrand> per upstream, only 1.10 and higher are affected:
  http://lists.x.org/pipermail/xorg-devel/2012-May/031411.html
 sbeattie> with experimentation, was not able to cause the 1.10 server
  to crash in natty and oneiric, marking those not-affected
