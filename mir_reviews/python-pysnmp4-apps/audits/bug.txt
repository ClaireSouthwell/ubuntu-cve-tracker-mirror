I reviewed python-pysnmp4-apps version 0.3.2-1 as checked into utopic.
This should not be considered a full security audit, but rather a quick
gauge of code maintainability.

- This package provides snmp tools similar to the netsnmp tools.
- Build-Depends: debhelper, cdbs, python-all, python-setuptools
- Does not itself do cryptography
- Does not itself do networking
- Does not daemonize
- No pre/post inst/rm
- No initscripts
- No dbus
- No setuid
- No sudo fragments
- No udev rules
- No cronjobs
- No testsuite
- Clean build logs

- No spawned subprocesses
- No memory management (Python)
- No file manipulation
- Logging looks sane
- No environment variables
- No privileged operations
- No cryptography (user interface selects among authentication and privacy
  options to be used in snmp)
- No privileged portions of code
- No temporary files
- No WebKit
- No Javascript
- No PolicyKit

python-pysnmp4-apps is high-quality, high-density code -- while fixes
might be difficult, I suspect there aren't many bugs to be found.

Security team ACK for promoting python-pysnmp4-apps to main.
