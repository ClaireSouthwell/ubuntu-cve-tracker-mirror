Description:
 Integer overflow in the xml_utf8_decode function in ext/xml/xml.c in PHP
 before 5.2.11 makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass cross-site
 scripting (XSS) and SQL injection protection mechanisms via a crafted
 string that uses overlong UTF-8 encoding, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2010-3870.
