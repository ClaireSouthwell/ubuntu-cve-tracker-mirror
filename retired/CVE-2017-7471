Description:
 9p: virtfs allows guest to change filesystem attributes on host
 The local backend was recently converted to using "at*()" syscalls in order
 to ensure all accesses happen below the shared directory. This requires that
 we only pass relative paths, otherwise the dirfd argument to the "at*()"
 syscalls is ignored and the path is treated as an absolute path in the host.
 This is actually the case for paths in all fids, with the notable exception
 of the root fid, whose path is "/". This causes the following backend ops to
 act on the "/" directory of the host instead of the virtfs shared directory
 when the export root is involved.
