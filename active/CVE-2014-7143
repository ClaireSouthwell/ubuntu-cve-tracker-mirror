Description:
 When specifying the trustRoot (CA store) for the HTTP client, Twisted
 did not respect the user's specification, and always used the default
 of the platform trust. This means that users attempting to use this
 feature to implement certificate pinning, or otherwise restrict the
 trust CAs would still have accepted any certificate signed by a CA.
