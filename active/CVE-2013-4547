Description: 
 An attacker may bypass security restrictions in certain configurations
 by using a specially crafted request; some checks on a request URI were
 not executed on a character following an unescaped space character
 (which is invalid per HTTP protocol, but allowed for compatibility
 reasons since nginx 0.8.41).
