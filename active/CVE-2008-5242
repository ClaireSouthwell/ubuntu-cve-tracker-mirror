Description:
 demux_qt.c in xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and earlier versions, does
 not validate the count field before calling calloc for STSD_ATOM atom
 allocation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted media file.
