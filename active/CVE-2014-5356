Description:
 By uploading a large enough image to a Glance store, an authenticated
 user may fill the store space because the image_size_cap configuration
 option is not honored. This may prevent further image upload and/or cause
 service disruption. Note that the import method is not affected. All
 Glance setups using API v2 are affected (unless you use a policy to
 restrict/disable image upload).
