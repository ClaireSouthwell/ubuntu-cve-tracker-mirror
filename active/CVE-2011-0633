Description:
 The Net::HTTPS module in libwww-perl (LWP) before 6.00, as used in
 WWW::Mechanize, LWP::UserAgent, and other products, when running in
 environments that do not set the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header, does not
 enable full validation of SSL certificates by default, which allows remote
 attackers to spoof servers via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks involving
 hostnames that are not properly validated.  NOTE: it could be argued that
 this is a design limitation of the Net::HTTPS API, and separate
 implementations should be independently assigned CVE identifiers for not
 working around this limitation. However, because this API was modified
 within LWP, a single CVE identifier has been assigned.
