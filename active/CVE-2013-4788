Description:
 Failure to initialize random value (it is always zero) of the "pointer guard"
 when generating static compiled executables.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> PoC in linux-distros@ (tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 13.04 and Debian 7.1)
 jdstrand> Only statically compiled executables, dynamic not affected
 jdstrand> upstream patch not available as of 2013-07-12
 sarnold> PTR MANGLE is a security-hardening feature; exploiting this flaw
  requires a flaw in a statically linked executable that allows write
  access to one of the types of pointers that is mangled. Fixing the
  consequences of this flaw requires rebuilding all security-sensitive
  statically linked executables.
