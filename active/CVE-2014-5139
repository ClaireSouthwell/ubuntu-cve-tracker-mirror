Description: 
 Crash with SRP ciphersuite in Server Hello message. The issue affects
 OpenSSL clients and allows a malicious server to crash the client with a
 null pointer dereference (read) by specifying an SRP ciphersuite even
 though it was not properly negotiated with the client. This can be
 exploited through a Denial of Service attack.
