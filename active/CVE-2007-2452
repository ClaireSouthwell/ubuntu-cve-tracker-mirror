Candidate: CVE-2007-2452
References:
Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the visit_old_format function in
 locate/locate.c in locate in GNU findutils before 4.2.31 might allow
 context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long pathname
 in a locate database that has the old format, a different vulnerability
 than CVE-2001-1036.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> slocate runs instead of the findutils, and this would require an root-user-owned-db attack or similar.
