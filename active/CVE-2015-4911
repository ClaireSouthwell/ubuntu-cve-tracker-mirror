Description:
 It was discovered that the StAX XML parser in the JAXP component of
 OpenJDK could do certain DTD processing even when DTD support was
 disabled via the javax.xml.stream.supportDTD system property.  A
 specially crafted XML document could cause a Java application using
 JAXP to consume an excessive amount of memory and CPU time when parsed.
