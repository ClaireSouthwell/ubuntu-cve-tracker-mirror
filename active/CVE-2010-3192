Description:
 Certain run-time memory protection mechanisms in the GNU C Library (aka
 glibc or libc6) print argv[0] and backtrace information, which might allow
 context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from process
 memory by executing an incorrect program, as demonstrated by a setuid
 program that contains a stack-based buffer overflow error, related to the
 __fortify_fail function in debug/fortify_fail.c, and the __stack_chk_fail
 (aka stack protection) and __chk_fail (aka FORTIFY_SOURCE) implementations.
