Description:
 Improper input validation together with an integer overflow in the EAP-TLS
 protocol implementation in PPPD may cause a crash, information disclosure,
 or authentication bypass. This implementation is distributed as a patch for
 PPPD 0.91, and includes the affected eap.c and eap-tls.c files.
 Configurations that use the `refuse-app` option are unaffected.
