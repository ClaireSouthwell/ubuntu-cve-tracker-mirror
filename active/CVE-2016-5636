Description:
 Integer overflow in the get_data function in zipimport.c in CPython (aka
 Python) before 2.7.12, 3.x before 3.4.5, and 3.5.x before 3.5.2 allows
 remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a negative data size value,
 which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> issue is fixed for xenial/python3.5 and xenial/python2.7
   for packages in xenial-updates, but not xenial-security
 sbeattie> may also need https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/2edbdb79cd6d
   (see comment on python bug above) for pre-2.7.8 code and possibly 3.x
   code.
