Description:
 The sapi_header_op function in main/SAPI.c in PHP before 5.3.11 does not
 properly handle %0D sequences (aka carriage return characters), which
 allows remote attackers to bypass an HTTP response-splitting protection
 mechanism via a crafted URL, related to improper interaction between the
 PHP header function and certain browsers, as demonstrated by Internet
 Explorer and Google Chrome.
