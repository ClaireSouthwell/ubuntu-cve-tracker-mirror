Description: 
 Aki Helin found an integer underflow leading to array index error in
 the way gzip used to decompress files / archives, compressed with
 the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) compression algorithm. A remote attacker
 could provide a specially-crafted LZW compressed gzip archive, which
 once decompressed by a local, unsuspecting user (on 64 bit system) 
 would lead to denial of service (gzip crash), or, potentially to
 arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gzip.
