Description:
 In BlueZ 5.42, a buffer overflow was observed in "commands_dump" function
 in "tools/parser/csr.c" source file. The issue exists because "commands"
 array is overflowed by supplied parameter due to lack of boundary checks on
 size of the buffer from frame "frm->ptr" parameter. This issue can be
 triggered by processing a corrupted dump file and will result in hcidump
 crash.
