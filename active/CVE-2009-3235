Description:
 Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0
 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated
 by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
