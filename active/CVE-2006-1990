Candidate: CVE-2006-1990
References:
 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-320-1
Description:
 Integer overflow in the wordwrap function in string.c in PHP 4.4.2 and
 5.1.2 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 certain long arguments that cause a small buffer to be allocated, which
 triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in a memcpy function call, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2002-1396.
