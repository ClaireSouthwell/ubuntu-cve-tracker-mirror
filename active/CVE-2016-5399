Description:
 [Improper error handling in bzread()]
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> PHP position seems to suggest they'll fix bzread() to ensure
  it conforms to the documented behaviour but they won't take any steps
  to 'safe' an improper use of API by applications. Since the API was
  apparently not honoured before I don't know how an application could be
  expected to be correct.
