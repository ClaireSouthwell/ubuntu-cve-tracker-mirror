Description:
 Ansible, all ansible_engine-2.x versions and ansible_engine-3.x up to
 ansible_engine-3.5, was logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a
 disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged
 credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules,
 as those are executed in a separate process.
