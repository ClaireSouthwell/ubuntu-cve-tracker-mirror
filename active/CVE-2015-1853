Description:
 An attacker knowing that NTP hosts A and B are peering with each other
 (symmetric association) can send a packet with random timestamps to host
 A with source address of B which will set the NTP state variables on A to
 the values sent by the attacker. Host A will then send on its next poll
 to B a packet with originate timestamp that doesn't match the transmit
 timestamp of B and the packet will be dropped. If the attacker does this
 periodically for both hosts, they won't be able to synchronize to each
 other. Authentication using a symmetric key can fully protect against
 this attack, but in implementations following the NTPv3 (RFC 1305) or
 NTPv4 (RFC 5905) specification the state variables were updated even when
 the authentication check failed and the association was not protected.
