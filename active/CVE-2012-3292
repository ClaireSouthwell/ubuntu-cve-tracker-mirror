Description:
 The GridFTP in Globus Toolkit (GT) before 5.2.2, when certain autoconf
 macros are defined, does not properly check the return value from the
 getpwnam_r function, which might allow remote attackers to gain privileges
 by logging in with a user that does not exist, which causes GridFTP to run
 as the last user in the password file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> it affects releases older than 5.2 if threading was enabled
