Description:
 When Private Browsing mode is used, it is possible for a web worker to
 write persistent data to IndexedDB and fingerprint a user uniquely.
 IndexedDB should not be available in Private Browsing mode and this stored
 data will persist across multiple private browsing mode sessions because it
 is not cleared when exiting. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
 52.5.2 and Firefox < 57.0.1.
