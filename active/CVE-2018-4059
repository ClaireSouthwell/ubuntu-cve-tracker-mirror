Description:
 An exploitable unsafe default configuration vulnerability exists in the
 TURN server function of coTURN prior to version 4.5.0.9. By default, the
 TURN server runs an unauthenticated telnet admin portal on the loopback
 interface. This can provide administrator access to the TURN server
 configuration, which can lead to additional attacks. An attacker who can
 get access to the telnet port can gain administrator access to the TURN
 server.
