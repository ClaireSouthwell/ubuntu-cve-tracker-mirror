Description: 
 When checking for a skewed offset section UPX-packed executables ,
 it would not rule out a possible skew value that was larger than the
 size of the PE section. Because of unsigned math, it would cause the
 resulting expected section size to rollover to exceedingly large values
 and try inappropriate heap reads.
