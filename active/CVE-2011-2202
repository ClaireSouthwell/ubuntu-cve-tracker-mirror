Description:
 The rfc1867_post_handler function in main/rfc1867.c in PHP before 5.3.7
 does not properly restrict filenames in multipart/form-data POST requests,
 which allows remote attackers to conduct absolute path traversal attacks,
 and possibly create or overwrite arbitrary files, via a crafted upload
 request, related to a "file path injection vulnerability."
