Description:
 ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p4 before 4.2.8p11 drops bad packets before updating the
 "received" timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (disruption) by sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp
 causing the association to reset and setting the contents of the packet as
 the most recent timestamp. This issue is a result of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2015-7704.
