Description: 
 The bdf parser reads a count for the number of properties defined in
 a font from the font file, and allocates arrays with entries for each
 property based on that count.  It never checked to see if that count
 was negative, or large enough to overflow when multiplied by the size
 of the structures being allocated, and could thus allocate the wrong
 buffer size, leading to out of bounds writes.
