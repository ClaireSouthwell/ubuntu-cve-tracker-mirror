Description:
 In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value
 placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not
 initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by
 mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could
 reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior
 request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a
 segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service.
