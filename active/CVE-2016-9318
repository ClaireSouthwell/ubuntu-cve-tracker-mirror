Description:
 libxml2 2.9.4 and earlier, as used in XMLSec 1.2.23 and earlier and other
 products, does not offer a flag directly indicating that the current
 document may be read but other files may not be opened, which makes it
 easier for remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
 via a crafted document.
