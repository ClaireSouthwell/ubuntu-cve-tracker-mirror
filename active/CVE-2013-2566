Description:
 The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, has many
 single-byte biases, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
 plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of ciphertext in a
 large number of sessions that use the same plaintext.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> this is a protocol problem not specific to openssl. Using openssl
  as a placeholder until more information is available
 jdstrand> marking low for now until more information is available. At present,
  naive attacks need tens to hundreds of millions of TLS connections. Optimized
  attacks are not present yet.
 jdstrand> marking deferred since there is no consensus on what to do (we can't
  just disable RC4)
