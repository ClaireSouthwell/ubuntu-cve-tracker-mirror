Description:
 A TOCTOU race condition was found in the way 'annotate-output' (used to
 execute a program annotating the output linewise with time and stream) tool of
 rpmdevtools, a suite of scripts and (X)Emacs support files to aid in
 development of RPM packages, performed management of its temporary files used
 for standard output and standard error output. A local attacker could use this
 flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, possibly leading to their ability in an
 unauthorized way to alter files belonging to the user running the
 'annotate-output' tool.
