Description:
 an array index error, leading to out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found
 in the way net-snmp agent performed entries lookup in the extension table.
 When certain MIB subtree was handled by the extend directive, a remote
 attacker having read privilege to the subtree could use this flaw to cause a
 denial of service (snmpd crash) via SNMP GET request involving a non-existent
 extension table entry.
