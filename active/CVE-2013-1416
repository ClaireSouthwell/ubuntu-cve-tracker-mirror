Description:
 The prep_reprocess_req function in do_tgs_req.c in the Key Distribution
 Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.10.5 does not properly
 perform service-principal realm referral, which allows remote authenticated
 users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon
 crash) via a crafted TGS-REQ request.
