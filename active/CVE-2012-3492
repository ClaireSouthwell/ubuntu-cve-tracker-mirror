Description:
 It was discovered that Condor's file system authentication challenge
 accepted directories with weak permissions (for example, world readable,
 writable and executable permissions). If a user created a directory with
 such permissions, a local attacker could rename it, allowing them to
 execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user. (CVE-2012-3492)
