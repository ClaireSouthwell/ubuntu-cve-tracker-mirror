Description:
 PHP before 5.1.3-RC1 might allow remote attackers to obtain portions of
 memory via crafted binary data sent to a script that processes user input
 in the html_entity_decode function and sends the encoded results back to
 the client, aka a "binary safety" issue.  NOTE: this issue has been
 referred to as a "memory leak," but it is an information leak that
 discloses memory contents.
