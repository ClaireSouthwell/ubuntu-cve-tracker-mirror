Description:
 LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle
 vector graphics script, which can execute arbitrary python commands
 contained with the document it is launched from. LibreOffice also has a
 feature where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can be
 executed on various document script events such as mouse-over, etc.
 Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9848, to block calling LibreLogo
 from script event handers. However an insufficient url validation
 vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed malicious to bypass that protection
 and again trigger calling LibreLogo from script event handlers. This issue
 affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.
