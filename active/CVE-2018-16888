Description:
 It was discovered systemd does not correctly check the content of PIDFile
 files before using it to kill processes. When a service is run from an
 unprivileged user (e.g. User field set in the service file), a local
 attacker who is able to write to the PIDFile of the mentioned service may
 use this flaw to trick systemd into killing other services and/or
 privileged processes. Versions before v237 are vulnerable.
