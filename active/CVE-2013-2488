Description:
 The DTLS dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.14 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6
 does not validate the fragment offset before invoking the reassembly state
 machine, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via a large offset value that triggers write access to
 an invalid memory location.
