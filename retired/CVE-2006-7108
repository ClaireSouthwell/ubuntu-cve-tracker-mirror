Candidate: CVE-2006-7108
References:
Description:
 login in util-linux-2.12a skips pam_acct_mgmt and chauth_tok when
 authentication is skipped, such as when a Kerberos krlogin session has been
 established, which might allow users to bypass intended access policies
 that would be enforced by pam_acct_mgmt and chauth_tok.
