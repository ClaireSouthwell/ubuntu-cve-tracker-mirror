Description:
 Inconsistent and non-validating HTTPS client
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> swift not-affected per upstream
 jdstrand> per upstream, all occurences are "for serverside node-to-node
  communication that could be assumed to happen on private networks". 'use_ssl'
  does convey protection, but there is no way to specify a ca_file. Adjusting
  priority to low since client to server communications are not affected (just
  server to server and middleware to server) and upstream and Ubuntu
  documentation all state the OpenStack components should be on a trusted
  network segment
 jdstrand> uses httplib.HTTPSConnection objects which are not fixed in Ubuntu.
  Could use pycurl, python3, or httplib2.
 jdstrand> upstream will fix as a secure feature in a future version because
  this will break upgrades. Nothing to be done at this time. Leaving 13.10
  open, but deferred, since the 13.10 will have a newer version.
