Description:
 Possible XSS in traceback section of technical 500 debug page
 In older versions, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the
 template for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances,
 this allowed a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't
 affect most production sites since you shouldn't run with DEBUG = True (which
 makes this page accessible) in your production settings.
