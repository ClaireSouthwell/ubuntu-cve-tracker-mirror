Candidate: CVE-2007-4784
References: 
Description: 
 The setlocale function in PHP before 5.2.4 allows context-dependent attackers
 to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a long string in the
 locale parameter. NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability in most web server
 environments that support multiple threads, unless this issue can be
 demonstrated for code execution.
