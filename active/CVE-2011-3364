Description: 
 An input sanitization flaw was found in the way the ifcfg-rh
 NetworkManager plug-in escaped network connection names containing special
 characters. If PolicyKit was configured to allow local, unprivileged users
 to create and save new network connections, they could create a connection
 with a specially-crafted name, leading to the escalation of their
 privileges. Note: By default, PolicyKit prevents unprivileged users from
 creating and saving network connections.

Notes: 
 mdeslaur> This is for the redhat-specific plugin, but we need to check
 mdeslaur> if the debian plugin has the same flaw, as it may be based on
 mdeslaur> the same code
