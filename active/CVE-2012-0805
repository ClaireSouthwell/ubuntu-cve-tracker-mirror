Description: 
 It was discovered that SQLAlchemy did not sanitize values for the limit and
 offset keywords for SQL select statements. If an application using
 SQLAlchemy accepted values for these keywords, and did not filter or
 sanitize them before passing them to SQLAlchemy, it could allow an attacker
 to perform an SQL injection attack against the application.
