Description: 
 When doing GSSAPI authentication, libcurl unconditionally performs
 credential delegation. This hands the server a copy of the client's
 security credential, allowing the server to impersonate the client
 to any other using the same GSSAPI mechanism. This is obviously a
 very sensitive operation, which should only be done when the user
 explicitly so directs.
