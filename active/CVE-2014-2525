Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser
 and emitter library. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML
 document that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause the
 application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the user running the application.
