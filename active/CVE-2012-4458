 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4629
Description:
 It was found that the AMQP type decoder in qpidd allowed arbitrary data
 types in certain messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
 send a message containing an excessively large amount of data, causing
 qpidd to allocate a large amount of memory. qpidd would then be killed
 by the Out of Memory killer (denial of service).
