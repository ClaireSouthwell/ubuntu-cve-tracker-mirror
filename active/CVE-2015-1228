Description:
 The RenderCounter::updateCounter function in
 core/rendering/RenderCounter.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 41.0.2272.76, does not force a relayout operation and consequently does not
 initialize memory for a data structure, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequence.
