Description:
 The CPDF_Document::GetPage function in
 fpdfapi/fpdf_parser/fpdf_parser_document.cpp in PDFium, as used in Google
 Chrome before 46.0.2490.71, does not properly perform a cast of a
 dictionary object, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF
 document.
