Candidate: CVE-2007-5276
References:
Description:
 Opera 9 drops DNS pins based on failed connections to irrelevant TCP ports,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct DNS rebinding
 attacks, as demonstrated by a port 81 URL in an IMG SRC, when the DNS pin
 had been established for a session on port 80.
