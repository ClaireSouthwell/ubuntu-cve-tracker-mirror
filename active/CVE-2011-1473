Description:
 Most TLS/SSL implementations handle session renegotiation by default, client
 may trigger high CPU use by renegotiating repeatedly and taking advantage of
 the fact that there's more work to do on the server side than on the client
 side.  Similar problem affects initial handshake too, renegotiation allows
 achieving the same over single / few connections.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Protocol issue. Nothing to be done at this time. Marking low
  because while renegotiation makes the DoS faster, standard DoS methods
  still apply for SSL servers that need to setup the SSL connection.
 jdstrand> per Redhat, should not affect httpd/mod_ssl
