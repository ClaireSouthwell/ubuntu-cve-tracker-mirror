Description:
 The WebRequest API implementation in
 extensions/browser/api/web_request/web_request_api.cc in Google Chrome
 before 45.0.2454.85 does not properly consider a request's source before
 accepting the request, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
 access restrictions via a crafted (1) app or (2) extension.
