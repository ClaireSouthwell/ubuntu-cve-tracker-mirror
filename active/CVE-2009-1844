Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Drupal 5.x before
 5.18 and 6.x before 6.12 allow (1) remote authenticated users to inject
 arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted UTF-8 byte sequences that are
 treated as UTF-7 by Internet Explorer 6 and 7, which are not properly
 handled in the "HTML exports of books" feature; and (2) allow remote
 authenticated users with administer taxonomy permissions to inject
 arbitrary web script or HTML via the help text of an arbitrary vocabulary.
 NOTE: vector 1 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-1575.
