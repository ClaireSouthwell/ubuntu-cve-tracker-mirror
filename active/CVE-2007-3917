Candidate: CVE-2007-3917
References:
Description:
 The multiplayer engine in Wesnoth before 1.2.7 allows remote servers to
 cause a denial of service (crash) via a long message with multibyte
 characters that can produce an invalid UTF-8 string after it is truncated,
 which triggers an uncaught exception, involving the truncate_message
 function in server/server.cpp.
