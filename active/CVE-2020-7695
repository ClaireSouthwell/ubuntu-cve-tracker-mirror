Description:
 This affects all versions of package uvicorn. Uvicorn's implementation of
 the HTTP protocol for the httptools parser is vulnerable to HTTP response
 splitting. CRLF sequences are not escaped in the value of HTTP headers.
 Attackers can exploit this to add arbitrary headers to HTTP responses, or
 even return an arbitrary response body, whenever crafted input is used to
 construct HTTP headers.
