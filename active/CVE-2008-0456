Description:
 CRLF injection vulnerability in the mod_negotiation module in the Apache
 HTTP Server 2.2.6 and earlier in the 2.2.x series, 2.0.61 and earlier in
 the 2.0.x series, and 1.3.39 and earlier in the 1.3.x series allows remote
 authenticated users to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP
 response splitting attacks by uploading a file with a multi-line name
 containing HTTP header sequences and a file extension, which leads to
 injection within a (1) "406 Not Acceptable" or (2) "300 Multiple Choices"
 HTTP response when the extension is omitted in a request for the file.
