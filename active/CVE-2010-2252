Description:
 GNU Wget 1.12 and earlier uses a server-provided filename instead of the
 original URL to determine the destination filename of a download, which
 allows remote servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a 3xx
 redirect to a URL with a .wgetrc filename followed by a 3xx redirect to a
 URL with a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a
 consequence of writing to a dotfile in a home directory.
