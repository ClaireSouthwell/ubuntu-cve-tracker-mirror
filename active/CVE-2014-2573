Description:
 The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) 2013.2 through 2013.2.2 does
 not properly put VMs into RESCUE status, which allows remote authenticated
 users to bypass the quota limit and cause a denial of service (resource
 consumption) by requesting the VM be put into rescue and then deleting the
 image.
