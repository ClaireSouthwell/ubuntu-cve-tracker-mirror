Description:
 A cryptographic cache-based side channel in the RSA implementation in Botan
 before 1.10.17, and 1.11.x and 2.x before 2.3.0, allows a local attacker to
 recover information about RSA secret keys, as demonstrated by CacheD. This
 occurs because an array is indexed with bits derived from a secret key.
