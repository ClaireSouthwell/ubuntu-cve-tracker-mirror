Description:
 An issue was discovered in Botan 1.11.32 through 2.x before 2.6.0. An
 off-by-one error when processing malformed TLS-CBC ciphertext could cause
 the receiving side to include in the HMAC computation exactly 64K bytes of
 data following the record buffer, aka an over-read. The MAC comparison will
 subsequently fail and the connection will be closed. This could be used for
 denial of service. No information leak occurs.
