Description: 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the read_channel_data function in file-psp.c
 in the Paint Shop Pro (PSP) plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
 code via a PSP_COMP_RLE (aka RLE compression) image file that begins a long
 run count at the end of the image. NOTE: some of these details are obtained
 from third party information.
