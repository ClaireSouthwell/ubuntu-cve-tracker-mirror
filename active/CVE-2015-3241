Description:
 OpenStack Compute (nova) 2015.1 through 2015.1.1, 2014.2.3, and earlier
 does not stop the migration process when the instance is deleted, which
 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (disk,
 network, and other resource consumption) by resizing and then deleting an
 instance.
