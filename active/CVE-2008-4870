Description:
 dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora,
 uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users
 to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> marking as low because the default configuration doesn't set
   ssl_key_password
 mdeslaur> file permissions can't be changed because of "deliver"
 mdeslaur> Red Hat backported a new "!include_try" directive to the config
 mdeslaur> file that allows including a second permission-protected 
 mdeslaur> config file (taken from 1.1.7)
 mdeslaur> Debian says "by default this file doesnt containt sensitive
 mdeslaur> information and administrator changing this should ensure on its
 mdeslaur> own that the mode is secure"
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> after discussion with kees and jdstrand, here's our plan:
 mdeslaur> TODO: add a warning to the default conf file.
