Candidate: CVE-2007-4965
References: 
Description: 
 Multiple integer overflows in the imageop module in Python 2.5.1 and earlier
 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) and possibly obtain sensitive information (memory contents) via crafted
 arguments to (1) the tovideo method, and unspecified other vectors related to
 (2) imageop.c, (3) rbgimgmodule.c, and other files, which trigger heap-based
 buffer overflows.
