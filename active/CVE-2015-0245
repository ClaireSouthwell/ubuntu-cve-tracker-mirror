Description:
 [denial of service in dbus >= 1.4 systemd activation]
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> The policy change is recommended for stable use, though the
  code-based changes were made for platforms where uid==0 may not be
  omnipotent -- we should probably use both in our packages, or at least
  both for the versions with distro-patched AppArmor support.
