Description:
 The auth_token middleware in the OpenStack Python client library for
 Keystone (aka python-keystoneclient) before 0.7.0 does not properly
 retrieve user tokens from memcache, which allows remote authenticated users
 to gain privileges in opportunistic circumstances via a large number of
 requests, related to an "interaction between eventlet and
 python-memcached."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> According to upstream, this is difficult to reliably attack since it
  is dependent on server interactions
 jdstrand> code present in keystone in Essex and Folsom, python-keystoneclient
  in Grizzly and higher
