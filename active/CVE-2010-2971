Description:
 loaders/load_it.c in libmikmod, possibly 3.1.12, does not properly account
 for the larger size of name##env relative to name##tick and name##node,
 which allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer over-read and possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted Impulse Tracker file, a related
 issue to CVE-2010-2546.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete
 fix for CVE-2009-3995.
