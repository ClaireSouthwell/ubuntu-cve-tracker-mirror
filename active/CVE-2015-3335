Description:
 The NaClSandbox::InitializeLayerTwoSandbox function in
 components/nacl/loader/sandbox_linux/nacl_sandbox_linux.cc in Google Chrome
 before 42.0.2311.90 does not have RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_DATA limits for
 Native Client (aka NaCl) processes, which might make it easier for remote
 attackers to conduct row-hammer attacks or have unspecified other impact by
 leveraging the ability to run a crafted program in the NaCl sandbox.
