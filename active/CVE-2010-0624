Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the rmt_read__ function in lib/rtapelib.c in
 the rmt client functionality in GNU tar before 1.23 and GNU cpio before
 2.11 allows remote rmt servers to cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code by sending more data than
 was requested, related to archive filenames that contain a : (colon)
 character.
