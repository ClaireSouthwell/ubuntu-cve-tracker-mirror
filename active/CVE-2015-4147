Description:
 The SoapClient::__call method in ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before 5.4.39,
 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 does not verify that
 __default_headers is an array, which allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code by providing crafted serialized data with an unexpected data
 type, related to a "type confusion" issue.
