Description:
 cgi-bin/munin-cgi-graph in Munin 2.x writes data to a log file without
 sanitizing non-printable characters, which might allow user-assisted remote
 attackers to inject terminal emulator escape sequences and execute
 arbitrary commands or delete arbitrary files via a crafted HTTP request.
