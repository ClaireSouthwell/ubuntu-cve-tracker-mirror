Hello, I reviewed urfkill version 0.6.0~20150318.103828.5539c0d.1-0ubuntu5
as checked into yakkety. This shouldn't be considered a full security
audit but rather a quick gauge of maintainability.

urfkill provides user-space policy engine around the handling of software
and hardware kill switches for radio transmission. The kernel has some
mechanism around this but wants to have a userspace replacement.

urfkill integrates with dbus, polkit, consolekit, and systemd.

- Uses GetConnectionUnixProcessID and GetSessionByPID -- which may be
  subject to race conditions. I can't tell if this has security
  implications.

- urfkill's codebase has an odd habit of checking for errno == EACCES and
  either emitting a warning or changing the warning that's emitted.
  There's many reasons why the operations may fail, I think strerror()
  would be far more useful than just checking for the one condition.

- I don't understand the point of all the seat tracking

I didn't study the codebase very closely; that said, the two issues I
reported were both handled professionally and quickly. (One was already
fixed in master, but the author handled my report very politely.)

It'd be nice to pull in a new version from upstream as at least two issues
have been fixed.

Security team ACK for promoting urfkill to main.

Thanks
