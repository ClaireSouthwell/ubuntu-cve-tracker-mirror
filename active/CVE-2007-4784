Candidate: CVE-2007-4784
References: 
Description:
 The setlocale function in PHP before 5.2.4 allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a long
 string in the locale parameter.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability in
 most web server environments that support multiple threads, unless this
 issue can be demonstrated for code execution.
