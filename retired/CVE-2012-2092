Description:
 A Ubuntu-specific script called "cobbler-ubuntu-import" in the Ubuntu
 cobbler package downloads isos from a mirror, and checks them against
 MD5SUMS, but does not verify the validity of that MD5SUMS file itself
 against the MD5SUMS.gpg. This was fixed in version 2.2.2-0ubuntu32 of
 the package.

Notes:
 jdstrand> maas-provision in 12.04 is a code copy of cobbler, but with reduced
  features and usage. Only the portions of maas-provision specifically used by
  maas will recieve official support
