Description:
 In the Skinny channel driver, KEYPAD_BUTTON_MESSAGE events are queued for
 processing in a buffer allocated on the heap, where each DTMF value that is
 received is placed on the end of the buffer. Since the length of the buffer is
 never checked, an attacker could send sufficient KEYPAD_BUTTON_MESSAGE events
 such that the buffer is overrun.
