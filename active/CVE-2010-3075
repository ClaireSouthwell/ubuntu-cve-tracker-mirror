Description:
 EncFS before 1.7.0 encrypts multiple blocks by means of the CFB cipher mode
 with the same initialization vector, which makes it easier for local users
 to obtain sensitive information via calculations involving recovery of
 XORed data, as demonstrated by an attack on encrypted data in which the
 last block contains only one byte.
