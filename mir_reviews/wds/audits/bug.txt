Hello, I reviewed wds version 1.0.0-0ubuntu3 as checked into xenial. This
should not be considered a full security audit but rather a quick gauge of
maintainability.

- No CVE history in our database
- wds provides a framework for wifi display services
- Interacts with connman, gstreamer, wpa_supplicant's p2p; apparently two
  NIC families are recommended
- Build-Depends: debhelper, cmake, pkg-config, bison, flex,
  libglib2.0-dev, libgstreamer1.0-dev
- Can listen and connect to network sockets
- No cryptography
- The library does not daemonize, sink and source demos do, use glib
  routines instead of usual daemonization
- Runs as whatever user embeds the code
- No pre/post inst/rm scripts
- No initscripts
- No dbus services
- No setuid executables
- No privileged commands
- No sudo fragments
- No udev rules
- No cron jobs
- Only two tests in the test suite, unlikely to be useful
- Warning signed/unsigned comparisons, via lex. Probably not the direct
  fault of this application but do represent a real attack surface.

- No subprocesses spawned
- Memory management looked sane
- No direct file IO
- Logging looked safe
- No environment variables
- No privileged operations
- No cryptography
- Network input is handed directly to lex; the lexer looked well-written,
  but could represent significant attack surface
- No privileged portions of code
- No temporary files
- No WebKit
- No PolKit
- No javascript
- Clean cppcheck
- Clean enough shellcheck

I found one issue while reviewing wds, forgotten 'break' rules in a
'switch' statement. I filed https://github.com/01org/wds/issues/166 and
it got a quick response and quick fix. I didn't notice other instances
of this bug beyond this nearly-harmless instance.

The code looks like it's professionally programmed but I have the
impression that it's not quite feature-complete or fully debugging. This
is just intuition, but I'd feel far better if someone confirmed that
this code is actually fit for purpose with multiple peers and not just
tested with e.g. a Nexus 4 running an old Android.

Security team ACK for promoting wds to main.

Thanks
