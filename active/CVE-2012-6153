Description:
 http/conn/ssl/AbstractVerifier.java in Apache Commons HttpClient before
 4.2.3 does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain
 name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509
 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers
 via a certificate with a subject that specifies a common name in a field
 that is not the CN field.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete
 fix for CVE-2012-5783.
