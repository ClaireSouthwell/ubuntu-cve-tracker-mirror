Description:
 FastCGI interface. By default prior versions of HHVM would listen for FactCGI connections
 on all interfaces. This behavior may have been unexpected, and new releases change to listen
 on localhost by default. This behavior can be controlled by the hhvm.server.host INI setting.
 The HTTP server mode (Proxygen) continues to listen on all interfaces by default.
