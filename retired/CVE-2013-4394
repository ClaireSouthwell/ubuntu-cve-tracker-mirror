Description:
 A possibility of unauthorized Xorg X11 Server configuration file
 modification / injection was found in the way SetX11Keyboard() method of
 systemd, a system and service manager, performed sanitization of provided
 X Keyboard Extension (XKB) layouts description (special and control
 characters were not filtered out from the layout description properly).
 When the host in question used PolicyKit Local Authority (PKLA) file
 mechanism to grant group of users the privilege to change XKB settings
 (instead of default PolicyKit check) and particular local attacker was
 member of that group, they could use this flaw to inject arbitrary values
 into the Xorg X11 Server configuration file, possibly leading to
 escalation of their privileges.
