Description: 
 A flaw in ISC BIND was reported where a nameserver could be caused
 to exit with a REQUIRE exception if it received a specially crafted
 resource record with RDATA that exceeded 65535 bytes and then received
 a subsequent query for that record. This can be exploited remotely
 against recursive servers by getting them to query for records provided
 by an authoritative server. It also affects authoritative servers if a
 zone containing this kind of resource record is loaded from a file on
 disk or via a zone transfer.
