Candidate: CVE-2006-7230
References:
Description:
 Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.0 does not
 properly calculate the amount of memory needed for a compiled regular
 expression pattern when the (1) -x or (2) -i UTF-8 options change within
 the pattern, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (PCRE or glibc crash) via crafted regular expressions.
