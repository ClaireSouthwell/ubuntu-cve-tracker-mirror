Description:
 The TLS implementation in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) does not
 properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check
 operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows
 remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery
 attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a
 related issue to CVE-2013-0169.
