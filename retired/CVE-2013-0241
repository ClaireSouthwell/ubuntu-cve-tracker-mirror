Description:
 A flaw was found in the way spice connection breakups were handled in
 the qemu-kvm qxl driver. Some of the qxl port i/o commands were waiting
 for the spice server to complete the actions, while the corresponding
 thread holds qemu_mutex mutex, potentially blocking other threads in the
 guest's qemu-kvm process. An user able to initiate spice connection to
 the guest could use this flaw to make guest temporarily unavailable or,
 in case kernel.softlockup_panic in the guest was set, crash the guest.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> needs qemu-kvm patch (included in 1.0)
 mdeslaur> http://git.kernel.org/?p=virt/kvm/qemu-kvm.git;a=commit;h=5ff4e36c
 mdeslaur> oneiric and precise don't have spice enabled in the qemu-kvm
 mdeslaur> build. This probably only has an impact in environments where
 mdeslaur> a precise guest is running on a host with spice enabled, and
 mdeslaur> recent enough to supports async io. Downgrading priority to
 mdeslaur> low.
