Description:
 In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the DSA key pair
 generator generates a weak private key if used with default values. If the
 JCA key pair generator is not explicitly initialised with DSA parameters,
 1.55 and earlier generates a private value assuming a 1024 bit key size. In
 earlier releases this can be dealt with by explicitly passing parameters to
 the key pair generator.
