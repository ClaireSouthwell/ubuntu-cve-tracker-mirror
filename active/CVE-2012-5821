Description:
 Lynx does not verify that the server's certificate is signed by a trusted
 certification authority, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
 SSL servers via a crafted certificate, related to improper use of a certain
 GnuTLS function.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> 2.8.8dev.13 added a call to gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags(),
  but it wasn't enough to prompt for self-signed certificates
 jdstrand> patch submitted upstream
 jdstrand> as of 2012-11-15, upstream patch not available
