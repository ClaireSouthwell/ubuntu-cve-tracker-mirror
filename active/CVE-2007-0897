Description:
 Clam AntiVirus ClamAV before 0.90 does not close open file descriptors
 under certain conditions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (file descriptor consumption and failed scans) via CAB archives
 with a cabinet header record length of zero, which causes a function to
 return without closing a file descriptor.
