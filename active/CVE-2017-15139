Description:
 A vulnerability was found in openstack-cinder releases up to and including
 Queens, allowing newly created volumes in certain storage volume
 configurations to contain previous data. It specifically affects ScaleIO
 volumes using thin volumes and zero padding. This could lead to leakage of
 sensitive information between tenants.
Ubuntu-Description:
 The volume_clear option is not appropriate for scaleio, it's only for
 drivers where the data path is managed by cinder volume (LVM, block
 device driver, etc.)
 If scaleio is provisioning volumes that have pre-existing data on them,
 that is a serious bug in the scaleio backend or driver.
 It should not expose data of previously deleted volumes, and whatever is
 needed to fix that behavior should not be optional.
