Description:
 Integer overflow in the ReadImage function in
 plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c in the GIF image format plug-in in GIMP
 2.8.x and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted height
 and len properties in a GIF image file, which triggers a heap-based buffer
 overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
 information.
