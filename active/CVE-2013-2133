Description:
 A vulnerability was identified in the way in which method-level
 authorization for JAX-WS Service endpoints was performed by the
 EJB invocation handler implementation. Any restrictions declared
 on EJB methods were ignored when executing the JAX-WS handlers and
 only class-level restrictions were applied. A remote attacker who is
 authorized to access the EJB class, could invoke a JAX-WS handler that
 they are not authorized to.
