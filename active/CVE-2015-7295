Description:
 Qemu emulator built with the Virtual Network Device(virtio-net) support
 is vulnerable to a DoS issue. It could occur while receiving large
 packets over the tuntap/macvtap interfaces and when guest's virtio-net
 driver did not support big/mergeable receive buffers. An attacker on
 the local network could use this flaw to disable guest's networking
 by sending a large number of jumbo frames to the guest, exhausting all
 receive buffers and thus leading to a DoS situation.
