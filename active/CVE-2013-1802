References:
 http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1802
Description:
 The extlib gem 0.9.15 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts
 of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
 object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of
 service (memory and CPU consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for
 (1) YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion, a similar
 vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
