Description:
 The Word processor in OpenOffice.org 1.1.2 through 1.1.5 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted (1) .doc, (2) .wri, or (3) .rtf Word 97 file
 that triggers memory corruption, as exploited in the wild in December 2008,
 as demonstrated by 2008-crash.doc.rar, and a similar issue to
 CVE-2008-4841.
