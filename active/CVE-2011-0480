 Multiple buffer overflows in vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg,
 as used in Google Chrome before 8.0.552.237 and Chrome OS before
 8.0.552.344, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
 via a crafted WebM file, related to buffers for (1) the channel floor and
 (2) the channel residue.
