Description:
 The net/http package in Go through 1.6 does not attempt to address RFC 3875
 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect CGI
 applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY
 environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect a CGI
 application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a
 crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy" issue.

 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
