Description:
 PowerDNS Recursor before 3.1.5 uses insufficient randomness to calculate
 (1) TRXID values and (2) UDP source port numbers, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to poison a DNS cache, related to (a) algorithmic
 deficiencies in rand and random functions in external libraries, (b) use of
 a 32-bit seed value, and (c) choice of the time of day as the sole seeding
 information.
