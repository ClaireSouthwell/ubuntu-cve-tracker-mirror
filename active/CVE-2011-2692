Description:
 The png_handle_sCAL function in pngrutil.c in libpng 1.0.x before 1.0.55,
 1.2.x before 1.2.45, 1.4.x before 1.4.8, and 1.5.x before 1.5.4 does not
 properly handle invalid sCAL chunks, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted PNG image that triggers the
 reading of uninitialized memory.
