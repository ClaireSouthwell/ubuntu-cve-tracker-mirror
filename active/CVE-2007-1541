Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in am.pl in SQL-Ledger 2.6.27 only checks
 for the presence of a NULL (%00) character to protect against directory
 traversal attacks, which allows remote attackers to run arbitrary
 executables and bypass authentication via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the
 login parameter.
