Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow exists in the PNG loading functionality of
 the Blender open-source 3d creation suite version 2.78c. A specially
 crafted '.png' file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer
 overflow which can allow for code execution under the context of the
 application. An attacker can convince a user to use the file as an asset
 via the sequencer in order to trigger this vulnerability.
