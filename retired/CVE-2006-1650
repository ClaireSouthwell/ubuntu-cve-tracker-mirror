Description:
 Firefox 1.5.0.1 allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar and
 possibly conduct phishing attacks by re-opening the window to a malicious
 Shockwave Flash application, then changing the window location back to a
 trusted URL while the Flash application is still loading.  NOTE: a followup
 was unable to replicate this issue.
