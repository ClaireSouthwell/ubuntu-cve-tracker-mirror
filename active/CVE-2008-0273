Description:
 Interpretation conflict in Drupal 4.7.x before 4.7.11 and 5.x before 5.6,
 when Internet Explorer 6 is used, allows remote attackers to conduct
 cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via invalid UTF-8 byte sequences, which
 are not processed as UTF-8 by Drupal's HTML filtering, but are processed as
 UTF-8 by Internet Explorer, effectively removing characters from the
 document and defeating the HTML protection mechanism.
