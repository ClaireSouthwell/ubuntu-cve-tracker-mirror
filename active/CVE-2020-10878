Description:
 [This vulnerability is an attacker controlled corruption of the
  intermediate language state of a compiled regular expression. The
  corruption occurs due to integer overflows in the calculation of offsets
  between instructions for the regular expression engine. An attacker
  could abuse this behavior to insert instructions into the compiled form
  of a Perl regular expression.

  An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if
  it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating
  regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the
  regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service
  attacks in this usage scenario.]
