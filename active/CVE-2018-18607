Description:
 An issue was discovered in elf_link_input_bfd in elflink.c in the Binary
 File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils
 2.31. There is a NULL pointer dereference in elf_link_input_bfd when used
 for finding STT_TLS symbols without any TLS section. A specially crafted
 ELF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service, as demonstrated
 by ld.
