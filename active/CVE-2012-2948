Description:
 chan_skinny.c in the Skinny (aka SCCP) channel driver in Certified Asterisk
 1.8.11-cert before 1.8.11-cert2 and Asterisk Open Source 1.8.x before
 1.8.12.1 and 10.x before 10.4.1 allows remote authenticated users to cause
 a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) by closing
 a connection in off-hook mode.

 A remote attacker with a valid SCCP ID can can use this vulnerability by
 closing a connection to the Asterisk server in certain call states (e.g. "Off
 hook") to crash the server. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would
 result in termination of the server, causing denial of service to legitimate
 users.
