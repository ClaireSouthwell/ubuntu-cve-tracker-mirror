Description:
 [arbitrary command execution vulnerability on case-insensitive file
 systems]
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> This CVE is about the git VCS. The "git" from hardy and earlier is
  not what was "git-core".
 jdstrand> Maverick and later renamed 'git-core' to 'git', so 'git' in these
  releases does refer to git VCS.
 jdstrand> marking 'low' since default filesystems on Ubuntu are
  case-sensitive.
