Description:
 The Java Plug-in in Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime
 Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 17 and earlier; 6 Update 12 and earlier; and
 1.4.2_19 and earlier does not prevent Javascript that is loaded from the
 localhost from connecting to other ports on the system, which allows
 user-assisted attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via
 LiveConnect, aka CR 6724331.  NOTE: this vulnerability can be leveraged
 with separate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities for remote attack
 vectors.
