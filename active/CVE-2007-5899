Candidate: CVE-2007-5899
References: 
Description: 
 The output_add_rewrite_var function in PHP before 5.2.5 rewrites local
 forms in which the ACTION attribute references a non-local URL, which
 allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information by
 reading the requests for this URL, as demonstrated by a rewritten form
 containing a local session ID.
