Description:
 The ParamTraits<SkBitmap>::Read function in common/common_param_traits.cc
 in Google Chrome before 4.0.249.78 does not use the correct variables in
 calculations designed to prevent integer overflows, which allows attackers
 to leverage renderer access to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via bitmap data, related to deserialization.
