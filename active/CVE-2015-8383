Description:
 PCRE before 8.38 mishandles certain repeated conditional groups, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as
 demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> Issue affects PCRE3 only
 tyhicks> Marking 'low' since it requires PCRE to operate on untrusted regular
  expressions which is not very likely
 tyhicks> Per Debian, vulnerable code introduced in 8.34
