Description:
 The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not
 properly combine state data with key data during the initialization phase,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery
 attacks against the initial bytes of a stream by sniffing network traffic
 that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance Weakness, and
 then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the "Bar
 Mitzvah" issue.
