Description:
 The XSSAuditor::init function in core/html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp in the XSS
 auditor in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.117, processes
 POST requests by using the body of a redirecting page instead of the body
 of a redirect target, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information via unspecified vectors.
