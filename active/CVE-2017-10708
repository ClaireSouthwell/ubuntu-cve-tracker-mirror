Description: 
 An issue was discovered in Apport 2.5 through 2.20.5. In
 apport/report.py, Apport sets the ExecutablePath field and it then
 uses the path to run package specific hooks without protecting against
 path traversal. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 code.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 tyhicks> Apport registers itself as the default handler for .crash files so an
  attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious .crash file and execute
  arbitrary code as the user.
 tyhicks> A potential method of hardening apport against these types of attacks
  is to unregister it as the handler for .crash files.
