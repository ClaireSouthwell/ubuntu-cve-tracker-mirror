Description:
 ZoneMinder v1.30 and v1.29, an open-source CCTV server web application, is
 vulnerable to CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) which allows a remote
 attack to make changes to the web application as the current logged in
 victim. If the victim visits a malicious web page, the attacker can
 silently and automatically create a new admin user within the web
 application for remote persistence and further attacks. The URL is
 /zm/index.php and sample parameters could include action=user uid=0
 newUser[Username]=attacker1 newUser[Password]=Password1234
 conf_password=Password1234 newUser[System]=Edit (among others).
