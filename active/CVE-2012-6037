Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Mahara 1.4.x before
 1.4.5 and 1.5.x before 1.5.4, and other versions including 1.2, allow
 remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a CSV header
 with "unknown fields," which are not properly handled in error messages in
 the (1) bulk user, (2) group, and (3) group member upload capabilities.
 NOTE: this issue was originally part of CVE-2012-2243, but that ID was
 SPLIT due to different issues by different researchers.
