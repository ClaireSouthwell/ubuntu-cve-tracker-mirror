Description:
 A heap-based buffer overflow exists in GNU Bash before 4.3 when wide
 characters, not supported by the current locale set in the LC_CTYPE
 environment variable, are printed through the echo built-in function. A
 local attacker, who can provide data to print through the "echo -e"
 built-in function, may use this flaw to crash a script or execute code with
 the privileges of the bash process. This occurs because ansicstr() in
 lib/sh/strtrans.c mishandles u32cconv().
