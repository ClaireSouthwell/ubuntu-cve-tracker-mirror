Description:
 A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the String class, used
 in Ruby on Rails, performed HTML escaping of SafeBuffer objects, when such
 objects were manipulated directly via '[]' method or other methods, also
 returning new instances of SafeBuffer object. By using these methods, such
 newly returned SafeBuffer instances would be inadvertently marked as HTML safe.
 If a Ruby on Rails application used SafeBuffer objects this way, a remote
 attacker could provide a specially-crafted input, which once processed by such
 SafeBuffer instance would pass the HTML escaping test without further
 filtering, possibly leading to arbitrary HTML or webscript execution.
