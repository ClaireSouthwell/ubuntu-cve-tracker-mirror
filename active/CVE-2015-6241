Description:
 The proto_tree_add_bytes_item function in epan/proto.c in the protocol-tree
 implementation in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 does not properly
 terminate a data structure after a failure to locate a number within a
 string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via a crafted packet.
