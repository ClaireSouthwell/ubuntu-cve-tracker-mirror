Candidate: CVE-2007-5947
References:
Description:
 The jar protocol handler in Mozilla Firefox retrieves the inner URL
 regardless of its MIME type, and considers HTML documents within a jar
 archive to have the same origin as the inner URL, which allows remote
 attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a jar: URI.
