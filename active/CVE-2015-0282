Description:
 This issue only affects versions of GnuTLS prior to 3.1.0 (released in 2012).
 These versions don't verify the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm to match the
 signature algorithm in the certificate, leading to a potential downgrade to a
 disallowed algorithm, such as MD5, without detecting it.
