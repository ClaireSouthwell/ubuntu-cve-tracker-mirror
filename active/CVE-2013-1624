Description:
 The TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48 and C#
 library before 1.8 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks
 on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of malformed
 CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing
 attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing
 data for crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169.
