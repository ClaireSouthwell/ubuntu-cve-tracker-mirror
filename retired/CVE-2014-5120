Description:
 gd_ctx.c in the GD component in PHP 5.4.x before 5.4.32 and 5.5.x before
 5.5.16 does not ensure that pathnames lack %00 sequences, which might allow
 remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via crafted input to an
 application that calls the (1) imagegd, (2) imagegd2, (3) imagegif, (4)
 imagejpeg, (5) imagepng, (6) imagewbmp, or (7) imagewebp function.
