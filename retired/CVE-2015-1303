Description:
 bindings/core/v8/V8DOMWrapper.h in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 45.0.2454.101, does not perform a rethrow action to propagate information
 about a cross-context exception, which allows remote attackers to bypass
 the Same Origin Policy via a crafted HTML document containing an IFRAME
 element.
