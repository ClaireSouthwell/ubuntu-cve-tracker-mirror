Description:
 A resource-permission flaw was found in the
 openstack-tripleo-heat-templates package where
 ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created as world-readable. A local
 attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph cluster
 pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus
 potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume.
