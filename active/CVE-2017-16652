 https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/24995
Description:
 An issue was discovered in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.38, 2.8.x before
 2.8.31, 3.2.x before 3.2.14, and 3.3.x before 3.3.13.
 DefaultAuthenticationSuccessHandler or DefaultAuthenticationFailureHandler
 takes the content of the _target_path parameter and generates a redirect
 response, but no check is performed on the path, which could be an absolute
 URL to an external domain. This Open redirect vulnerability can be
 exploited for example to mount effective phishing attacks.
