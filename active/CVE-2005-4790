Description: 
 Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in SUSE Linux 9.3 and 10.0, and
 possibly other distributions, cause the working directory to be added to
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which might allow local users to execute arbitrary code via
 (1) beagle, (2) tomboy, or (3) blam. NOTE: in August 2007, the tomboy vector
 was reported for other distributions.
