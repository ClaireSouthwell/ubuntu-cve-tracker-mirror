Description:
 bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.4.9rc2, 0.5.x before 0.5.8rc2, 0.6.x
 before 0.6.5rc2, and 0.7.x before 0.7.3rc2, and wxBitcoin, do not properly
 consider whether a block's size could require an excessive number of
 database locks, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (split) and enable certain double-spending capabilities via a large block
 that triggers incorrect Berkeley DB locking.
