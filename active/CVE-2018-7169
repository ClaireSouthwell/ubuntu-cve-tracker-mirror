Description:
 An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is
 setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace
 where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove
 themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain
 filesystem paths if the administrator has used "group blacklisting" (e.g.,
 chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a
 security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups
 knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.
