 https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/6584
 https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/3629
Description:
 An Amazon Web Services (AWS) developer who does not specify the --owners
 flag when describing images via AWS CLI, and therefore not properly
 validating source software per AWS recommended security best practices, may
 unintentionally load an undesired and potentially malicious Amazon Machine
 Image (AMI) from the uncurated public community AMI catalog.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 msalvatore> This CVE may actually be against hashicorp/packer instead of
             awscli. Monitor https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/6584
             to see if this actually affects awscli.
 redhat> Closing this bug as NOTABUG and asked MITRE for rejection, since the
         issue does not seem to be in AWS CLI but in Packer.
