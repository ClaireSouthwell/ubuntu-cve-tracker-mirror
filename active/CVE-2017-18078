Description:
 systemd-tmpfiles in systemd before 237 attempts to support
 ownership/permission changes on hardlinked files even if the
 fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl is turned off, which allows local users to
 bypass intended access restrictions via vectors involving a hard link to a
 file for which the user lacks write access, as demonstrated by changing the
 ownership of the /etc/passwd file.
