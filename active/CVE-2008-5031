Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in Python 2.2.3 through 2.5.1, and 2.6, allow
 context-dependent attackers to have an unknown impact via a large integer
 value in the tabsize argument to the expandtabs method, as implemented by
 (1) the string_expandtabs function in Objects/stringobject.c and (2) the
 unicode_expandtabs function in Objects/unicodeobject.c.  NOTE: this
 vulnerability reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2008-2315.
