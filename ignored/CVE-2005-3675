Candidate: CVE-2005-3675
References: 
Description:
 The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (bandwidth consumption) by sending ACK messages for
 packets that have not yet been received (optimistic ACKs), which can cause
 the sender to increase its transmission rate until it fills available
 bandwidth.
