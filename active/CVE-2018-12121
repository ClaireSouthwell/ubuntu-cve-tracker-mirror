Description:
 Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0 and 11.3.0:
 Denial of Service with large HTTP headers: By using a combination of many
 requests with maximum sized headers (almost 80 KB per connection), and
 carefully timed completion of the headers, it is possible to cause the HTTP
 server to abort from heap allocation failure. Attack potential is mitigated
 by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer.
