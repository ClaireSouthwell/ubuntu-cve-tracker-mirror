Description:
 The (1) Conn_StartLogin and (2) cb_Read_Resolver_Result functions in conn.c
 in ngIRCd 18 through 20.2, when the configuration option NoticeAuth is
 enabled, does not properly handle the return code for the Handle_Write
 function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (assertion failure and server crash) via unspecified vectors, related to a
 "notice auth" message not being sent to a new client.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> A workaround exists, disable NoticeAuth. Only affects 20, 20.1,
  and 20.2.
