Description: 
 Puppet uses temp files unsafely by looking for a name it can use in a
 directory, and then later writing to that file, creating a
 vulnerability in which an attacker could make the name a symlink to
 another file and thereby cause the puppet agent to overwrite something
 that it did not intend to.
