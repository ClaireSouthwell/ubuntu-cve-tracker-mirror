Description: 
 svnwcsub.py and irkerbridge.py take a --pidfile option which creates a
 file containing the process id they are running as. Both of them do not
 take steps to ensure that the file they have been directed at is not a
 symlink. If the pid file is in a directory writeable by unprivileged
 users, the destination could be replaced by a symlink allowing for
 privilege escalation. Both are optional extra tools that are not
 installed by default and do not create a pid file by default.
