Description:
 A buggy or malicious HVM guest can crash the host. The hypercall argument
 translation needed for 32-bit guests running on 64-bit hypervisors
 performs checks on the final register state. These checks cover all
 registers potentially holding hypercall arguments, not just the ones
 actually doing so for the hypercall being processed, since the code
 was originally intended for use only by PV guests. While this is not a
 problem for PV guests (as they can't enter 64-bit mode and hence can't
 alter the high halves of any of the registers), the subsequent reuse of
 the same functionality for HVM guests exposed those checks to values
 (specifically, unexpected values for the high halves of registers not
 holding hypercall arguments) controlled by guest software.
