Description:
 The Red Hat build script for the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) before
 2.16.0-56 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 omits TCP Wrapper support,
 which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions
 via XDMCP connections, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-5079.
