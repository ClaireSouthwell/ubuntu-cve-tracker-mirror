Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in WordPress 2.2.1

 HTML via (1) the Options Database Table in the Admin Panel, accessed
 through options.php; or (2) the opml_url parameter to link-import.php. 
 NOTE: this might not cross privilege boundaries in some configurations,
 since the Administrator role has the unfiltered_html capability.
