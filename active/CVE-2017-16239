Description:
 In OpenStack Nova through 14.0.9, 15.x through 15.0.7, and 16.x through
 16.0.2, by rebuilding an instance, an authenticated user may be able to
 circumvent the Filter Scheduler bypassing imposed filters (for example, the
 ImagePropertiesFilter or the IsolatedHostsFilter). All setups using Nova
 Filter Scheduler are affected. Because of the regression described in
 Launchpad Bug #1732947, the preferred fix is a 14.x version after 14.0.10,
 a 15.x version after 15.0.8, or a 16.x version after 16.0.3.
