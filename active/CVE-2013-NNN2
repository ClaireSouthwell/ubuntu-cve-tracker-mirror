Description: 
 Potential bypass of sudo tty_tickets constraints
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> this all revolves around sudo's longstanding use of ttyname(). sudo
  stopped using ttyname() in 1.8.5 and 1.7.10 but had fallback behavior that
  continued to use ttyname() up until 1.8.6p6 and 1.7.10p5, where the fallback
  behavior was removed. sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p6 add the session id (sid) to
  the timestamp file for systems without /proc or sysctl
 jdstrand> this is a longstanding issue and may not be worth backporting the
  full fixes to earlier releases.
 jdstrand> The commits to use /proc may be incomplete-- 632f8e028191 for 1.7
  and for 1.8 are only the initial commits (ie, refinements and bug fix commits
  are not listed as of 2013/02/27)
