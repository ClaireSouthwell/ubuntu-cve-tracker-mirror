Description: 
 Due to libvirt not limiting guest access to ports less than 1024, users in
 guests that have root privileges (in the guest, independent of their
 privileges on the host), to obtain privileged resources on the host, as well
 as being able to access other resources by using it.  One example is with
 standard NFS exports now being accessible to the guests, because the guests
 will appear to be from the same IP as a possibly trusted host.
