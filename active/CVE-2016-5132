Description:
 The Service Workers subsystem in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82 does not
 properly implement the Secure Contexts specification during decisions about
 whether to control a subframe, which allows remote attackers to bypass the
 Same Origin Policy via an https IFRAME element inside an http IFRAME
 element.
