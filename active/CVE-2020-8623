Description:
 If BIND is built with "--enable-native-pkcs11" then a specially crafted
 query for a zone signed with RSA can trigger an assertion failure.  An
 attacker that can reach a vulnerable system with a specially crafted query
 packet can trigger a crash.  To be vulnerable, the system must either be
 running BIND that was built with "--enable-native-pkcs11", be signing one
 or more zones with an RSA key or be able to receive queries from a possible
 attacker.
