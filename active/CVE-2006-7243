Description:
 PHP before 5.3.4 accepts the \0 character in a pathname, which might allow
 context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by
 placing a safe file extension after this character, as demonstrated by
 .php\0.jpg at the end of the argument to the file_exists function.
