Description: 
 Access controls for the shimâ€™s API socket verified that the connecting process
 had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the
 abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in
 the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but
 otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated
 privileges.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sarnold> Containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be
  stopped and restarted.
 sarnold> Patches are in Message-ID: <ZIoq.1605308443822728072.OowG@lists.cncf.io
Mitigation: 
 A line like deny unix addr=@**, can be added to container AppArmor policy.
