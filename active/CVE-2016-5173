Description:
 The extensions subsystem in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.113 does not
 properly restrict access to Object.prototype, which allows remote attackers
 to load unintended resources, and consequently trigger unintended
 JavaScript function calls and bypass the Same Origin Policy via an indirect
 interception attack.
