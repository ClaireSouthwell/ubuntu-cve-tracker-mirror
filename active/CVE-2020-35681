 https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/3.0.3.html#cve-2020-35681-potential-leakage-of-session-identifiers-using-legacy-asgihandler
Description:
 The legacy channels.http.AsgiHandler class, used for handling HTTP type
 requests in an ASGI environment prior to Django 3.0, did not correctly
 separate request scopes in Channels 3.0. In many cases this would result in
 a crash but, with correct timing responses could be sent to the wrong
 client, resulting in potential leakage of session identifiers and other
 sensitive data.
