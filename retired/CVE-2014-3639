Description: 
 dbus-daemon allows a small number of "incomplete" connections (64 by
 default) whose identity has not yet been confirmed. When this limit has
 been reached, subsequent connections are dropped. Alban's testing
 indicates that one malicious process that makes repeated connection
 attempts, but never completes the authentication handshake and instead
 waits for dbus-daemon to time out and disconnect it, can cause the
 majority of legitimate connection attempts to fail.
