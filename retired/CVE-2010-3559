Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle Java SE and Java
 for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, 1.4.2_27, and 1.3.1_28 allows
 remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via
 unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the
 October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable
 researcher that this involves an incorrect sign extension in the
 HeadspaceSoundbank.nGetName function, which allows attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted BANK record that leads to a buffer overflow.
