Description:
 debconf in Debian GNU/Linux, when configuring mnogosearch in the
 mnogosearch-common 3.2.31-1 package, uses the world-readable config.dat
 file instead of the restricted passwords.dat for storing the cleartext
 database administrator password in the
 mnogosearch-common/database_admin_pass record, which allows local users to
 view the password.
