Description: 
 If a container image manifest in the Image V2 Schema 2 format includes
 a URL for the location of a specific image layer, ctr/containerd will
 follow that URL to attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.x,
 ctr/containerd will provide its authentication credentials if the
 server where the URL is located presents an HTTP 401 status code
 along with registry-specific HTTP headers.
 .
 If an attacker publishes a public image with a manifest that directs
 one of the layers to be fetched from a web server they control and
 they trick a user or system into pulling the image, they can obtain
 the credentials used by ctr/containerd. In some cases, this may be
 the user's username and password for the registry. In other cases,
 this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance
 which can grant access to other cloud resources in the account.
