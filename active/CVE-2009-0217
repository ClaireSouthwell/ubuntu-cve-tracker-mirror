Description:
 The design of the W3C XML Signature Syntax and Processing (XMLDsig)
 standard, as implemented in products including (1) the Oracle Security
 Developer Tools component in Oracle Application Server 10.1.2.3, 10.1.3.4,
 and 10.1.4.3IM; (2) the WebLogic Server component in BEA Product Suite
 10.3, 10.0 MP1, 9.2 MP3, 9.1, 9.0, and 8.1 SP6; and other products uses a
 parameter that defines an HMAC truncation length but does not require a
 minimum for this length, which allows attackers to bypass HMAC protection
 and spoof HMAC-based signatures by specifying a truncation length with a
 small number of bits.
