Description: 
 A flaw in a library used by BIND 9.7, 9.8, and 9.9, when compiled on
 Unix and related operating systems, allows an attacker to deliberately
 cause excessive memory consumption by the named process, potentially
 resulting in exhaustion of memory resources on the affected server. This
 condition can crash BIND 9 and will likely severely affect operation
 of other programs running on the same machine.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sarnold> No patch will be provided for 9.7. The suggested workaround is
  re-compile without regex support.
