Description:
 libgio, when used in setuid or other privileged programs in spice-gtk and
 possibly other products, allows local users to gain privileges and execute
 arbitrary code via the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable.  NOTE:
 it could be argued that this is a vulnerability in the applications that do
 not cleanse environment variables, not in libgio itself.

Notes: 
 mdeslaur> RedHat has fixed this in spice-gtk itself. As of 2012-10-05, no
 mdeslaur> sign of fix in glib2.0 git tree.
