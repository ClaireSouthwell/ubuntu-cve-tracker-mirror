Description:
 The ironic-api service in OpenStack Ironic before 4.2.5 (Liberty) and 5.x
 before 5.1.2 (Mitaka) allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information about a registered node by leveraging knowledge of the MAC
 address of a network card belonging to that node and sending a crafted POST
 request to the v1/drivers/$DRIVER_NAME/vendor_passthru resource.
