Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  The set_language_path function in geshi.php in Generic
 Syntax Highlighter (GeSHi) before 1.0.8.1 might allow remote attackers to
 conduct file inclusion attacks via crafted inputs that influence the
 default language path ($path variable).  NOTE: this issue has been disputed
 by a vendor, stating that only a static value is used, so this is not a
 vulnerability in GeSHi. Separate CVE identifiers would be created for web
 applications that integrate GeSHi in a way that allows control of the
 default language path.
