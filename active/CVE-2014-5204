 https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/29384
Description:
 wp-includes/pluggable.php in WordPress before 3.9.2 rejects invalid CSRF
 nonces with a different timing depending on which characters in the nonce
 are incorrect, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass a CSRF
 protection mechanism via a brute-force attack.
