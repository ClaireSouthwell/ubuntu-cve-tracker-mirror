Description: 
 integer overflows calculating memory needs for xfs replies
 These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory
 is needed to handle the returned data have not overflowed, so can
 result in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned
 data past the end of the allocated buffer.

Notes: 
 mdeslaur> trusty and later are built with --disable-fc, so this shouldn't
 mdeslaur> be an issue. Adding patch anyway for completeness' sake.
