Description:
 mod/lti/ajax.php in Moodle through 2.5.9, 2.6.x before 2.6.7, 2.7.x before
 2.7.4, and 2.8.x before 2.8.2 does not consider the
 moodle/course:manageactivities and mod/lti:addinstance capabilities before
 proceeding with registered-tool list searches, which allows remote
 authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via requests to the LTI
 Ajax service.
