Description:
 The msLoadQuery function in mapserv in MapServer 4.x before 4.10.4 and 5.x
 before 5.2.2 allows remote attackers to determine the existence of
 arbitrary files via a full pathname in the queryfile parameter, which
 triggers different error messages depending on whether this pathname
 exists.

Notes:
 jdstrand> this can only probe for files that are not present, useless when not
  in combination with another attack
