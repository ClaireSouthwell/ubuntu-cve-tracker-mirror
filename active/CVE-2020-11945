Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid before 5.0.2. A remote attacker can replay
 a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are
 otherwise forbidden. This occurs because the attacker can overflow the
 nonce reference counter (a short integer). Remote code execution may occur
 if the pooled token credentials are freed (instead of replayed as valid
 credentials).
