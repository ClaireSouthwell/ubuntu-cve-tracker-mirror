References: 
Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the bx_ne2k_c::rx_frame function in
 iodev/ne2k.cc in the emulated NE2000 device in Bochs 2.3 allows local users
 of the guest operating system to write to arbitrary memory locations and
 gain privileges on the host operating system via vectors that cause TXCNT
 register values to exceed the device memory size, aka "RX Frame heap
 overflow."
