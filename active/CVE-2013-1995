Description: 
 These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory
 is needed to handle the returned data have not had sign extension
 issues when converting smaller integer types to larger ones, leading to
 negative numbers being used in memory size calculations that can result
 in allocating too little memory and then writing the returned data past
 the end of the allocated buffer.
