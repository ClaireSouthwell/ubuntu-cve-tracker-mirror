Description:
 Multiple methods in libvirt 0.3.2 through 0.5.1 do not check if a
 connection is read-only, which allows local users to bypass intended access
 restrictions and perform administrative actions.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that libvirt did not mark certain operations as read-only. A
 local attacker may be able to perform privileged actions such as migrating
 virtual machines, adjusting autostart flags, or accessing privileged data in
 the virtual machine memory and disks. 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> should also be fixed in 0.5.1-4 in Debian experimental
