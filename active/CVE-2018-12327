Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in ntpq and ntpdc of NTP version 4.2.8p11
 allows an attacker to achieve code execution or escalate to higher
 privileges via a long string as the argument for an IPv4 or IPv6
 command-line parameter. NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any common
 situations in which ntpq or ntpdc is used with a command line from an
 untrusted source.
