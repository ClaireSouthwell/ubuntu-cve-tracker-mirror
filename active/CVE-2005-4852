Candidate: CVE-2005-4852
References: 
Description:
 The siteaccess URIMatching implementation in eZ publish 3.5 through 3.8
 before 20050812 converts all non-alphanumeric characters in a URI to '_'
 (underscore), which allows remote attackers to bypass access restrictions
 by inserting certain characters in a URI, as demonstrated by a request for
 /admin:de, which matches a rule allowing only /admin_de to access /admin.
