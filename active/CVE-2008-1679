Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in imageop.c in Python before 2.5.3 allow
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted images that trigger heap-based
 buffer overflows.  NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2007-4965.
