 Use-after-free vulnerability in the
 RenderBlock::collapseAnonymousBlockChild function in
 core/rendering/RenderBlock.cpp in the DOM implementation in Blink, as used
 in Google Chrome before 30.0.1599.66, allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging
 incorrect handling of parent-child relationships for anonymous blocks.
