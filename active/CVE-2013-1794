Description:
 By carefully crafting an ACL entry an attacker may overflow fixed
 length buffers within the OpenAFS fileserver, crashing the fileserver,
 and potentially permitting the execution of arbitrary code. To perform
 the exploit, the attacker must already have permissions to create ACLs
 on the fileserver in question.
