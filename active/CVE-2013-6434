Description:
 By default, remote-viewer first connects to insecure port and only
 switches to TLS when server requests/requires it when native spice
 client invocation method is used. An attacker on client local machine
 or on the router on the way can easily set up a MITM Evil Proxy that
 would pretend to be endpoint of plaintext port from client POV and it
 would act as a regular client to the server.

Notes:
 sarnold> Insufficient details were provided to determine where the fault
  is -- the Red Hat update is to their rhevm package -- so I've marked spice
  as the involved package until this can be researched further.
