Candidate: CVE-2007-1734
References: 
Description: 
 The DCCP support in the do_dccp_getsockopt function in net/dccp/proto.c in
 Linux kernel 2.6.20 and later does not verify the upper bounds of the optlen
 value, which allows local users running on certain architectures to read kernel
 memory or cause a denial of service (oops), a related issue to CVE-2007-1730.
