Description:
 The TIFFReadDirectory function in LibTIFF 3.9.0 does not properly validate
 the data types of codec-specific tags that have an out-of-order position in
 a TIFF file, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via a crafted file, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2010-2481.
