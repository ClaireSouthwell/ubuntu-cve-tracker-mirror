Description:
 Nomad 0.10.3 includes a fix for a privilege escalation vulnerability
 in validating TLS certificates for RPC with mTLS. Nomad RPC endpoints
 validated that TLS client certificates had not expired and were
 signed by the same CA as the Nomad node, but did not correctly check
 the certificate's name for the role and region as described in the
 Securing Nomad with TLS guide. This allows trusted operators with
 a client certificate signed by the CA to send RPC calls as a Nomad
 client or server node, bypassing access control and accessing any
 secrets available to a client.
