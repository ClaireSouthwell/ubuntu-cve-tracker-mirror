Description:
 The StatusManagerServlet could be loaded by a web application when a
 security manager was configured. This servlet would then provide the
 web application with a list of all deployed applications and a list of
 the HTTP request lines for all requests currently being processed. This
 could have exposed sensitive information from other web applications
 such as session IDs to the web application.
