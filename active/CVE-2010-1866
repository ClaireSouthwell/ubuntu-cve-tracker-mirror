Description:
 The dechunk filter in PHP 5.3 through 5.3.2, when decoding an HTTP chunked
 encoding stream, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (crash) and possibly trigger memory corruption via a negative chunk
 size, which bypasses a signed comparison, related to an integer overflow in
 the chunk size decoder.
