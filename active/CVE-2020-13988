Description: 
 The routine for parsing TCP MSS options relies on a uint8_t counter
 that under certain conditions will be only mutated depending on an
 arbitrary MSS optionâ€™s length value. If that length value is 0xff
 the counter will be decremented and thus pointing on a value the
 according to it the counter will be incremented. This will go one
 infinitely resulting on a DoS.
