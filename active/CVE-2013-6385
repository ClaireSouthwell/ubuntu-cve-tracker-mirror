Description:
 The form API in Drupal 6.x before 6.29 and 7.x before 7.24, when used with
 unspecified third-party modules, performs form validation even when CSRF
 validation has failed, which might allow remote attackers to trigger
 application-specific impacts such as arbitrary code execution via
 application-specific vectors.
