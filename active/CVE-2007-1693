Description:
 The SIP channel module in Yet Another Telephony Engine (Yate) before 1.2.0
 sets the caller_info_uri parameter using a incorrect variable that can be
 NULL, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
 dereference and application crash) via a Call-Info header without a purpose
 parameter.
