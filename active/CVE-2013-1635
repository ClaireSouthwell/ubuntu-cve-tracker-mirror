Description:
 ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before 5.3.22 and 5.4.x before 5.4.13 does not
 validate the relationship between the soap.wsdl_cache_dir directive and the
 open_basedir directive, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
 access restrictions by triggering the creation of cached SOAP WSDL files in
 an arbitrary directory.
