Description:
 Tinfoil Devise-two-factor before 2.0.0 does not strictly follow section 5.2
 of RFC 6238 and does not "burn" a successfully validated one-time password
 (aka OTP), which allows remote or physically proximate attackers with a
 target user's login credentials to log in as said user by obtaining the OTP
 through performing a man-in-the-middle attack between the provider and
 verifier, or shoulder surfing, and replaying the OTP in the current
 time-step.
