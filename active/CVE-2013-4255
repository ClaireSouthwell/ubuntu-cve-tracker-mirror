Description:
 The policy definition evaluator in Condor 7.5.4, 8.0.0, and earlier does
 not properly handle attributes in a (1) PREEMPT, (2) SUSPEND, (3) CONTINUE,
 (4) WANT_VACATE, or (5) KILL policy that evaluate to an Unconfigured,
 Undefined, or Error state, which allows remote authenticated users to cause
 a denial of service (condor_startd exit) via a crafted job.
