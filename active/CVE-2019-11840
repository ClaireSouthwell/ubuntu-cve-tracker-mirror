Description:
 An issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography libraries, aka
 golang-googlecode-go-crypto, before 2019-03-20. A flaw was found in the
 amd64 implementation of golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20 and
 golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20/salsa. If more than 256 GiB of keystream is
 generated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits, the
 amd64 implementation will first generate incorrect output, and then cycle
 back to previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can lead
 to loss of confidentiality in encryption applications, or to predictability
 in CSPRNG applications.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> snapd contains an embedded copy of golang-go.crypto
 jdstrand> the embedded copy contains the embedded code, but snapd does not
  use the salsa package in its sources.
