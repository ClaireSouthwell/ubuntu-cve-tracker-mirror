Description:
 MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.52, 5.1.x before 5.1.23, and 6.0.x before 6.0.4 does
 not update the DEFINER value of a view when the view is altered, which
 allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges via a sequence of
 statements including a CREATE SQL SECURITY DEFINER VIEW statement and an
 ALTER VIEW statement.

  jdstrand> patch from debian works on gutsy and feisty. On edgy and dapper
