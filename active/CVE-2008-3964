Description:
 Multiple off-by-one errors in libpng before 1.2.32beta01, and 1.4 before
 1.4.0beta34, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) or have unspecified other impact via a PNG image with crafted zTXt
 chunks, related to (1) the png_push_read_zTXt function in pngread.c, and
 possibly related to (2) pngtest.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per Debian, off-by-one error in pngpread.c is not present, must have
  been introduced later, but I think pngtest.c is affected
