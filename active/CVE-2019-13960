Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In libjpeg-turbo 2.0.2, a large amount of memory can be used
 during processing of an invalid progressive JPEG image containing incorrect
 width and height values in the image header. NOTE: the vendor's
 expectation, for use cases in which this memory usage would be a denial of
 service, is that the application should interpret libjpeg warnings as fatal
 errors (aborting decompression) and/or set limits on resource consumption
 or image sizes.
