Description:
 The process_packet function in ntp_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before
 4.2.8p8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (peer-variable
 modification) by sending spoofed packets from many source IP addresses in a
 certain scenario, as demonstrated by triggering an incorrect leap
 indication.
