Description:
 The index_urlfetch function in index.c in Cyrus IMAP 2.3.x before 2.3.19,
 2.4.x before 2.4.18, 2.5.x before 2.5.4 allows remote attackers to obtain
 sensitive information or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors
 related to the urlfetch range, which triggers an out-of-bounds heap read.
