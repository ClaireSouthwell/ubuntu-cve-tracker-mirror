Description: 
 Yubico library libu2f-host prior to version 1.1.7 contains an unchecked
 buffer, which could allow a buffer overflow. Libu2f-host is a library
 that implements the host party of the U2F protocol. This issue can
 allow an attacker with a custom made malicious USB device masquerading
 as a security key, and physical access to a computer where PAM U2F or
 an application with libu2f-host integrated, to potentially execute
 arbitrary code on that computer. Users of the YubiKey PAM U2F Tool are
 the most impacted since the arbitrary code could execute with elevated
 privileges. It is not possible to perform this attack with genuine
 YubiKey devices and users utilizing a browser implementation of U2F are
 not affected by this issue.
