Description:
 The dissect_nhdr_extopt function in epan/dissectors/packet-lbmc.c in the
 LBMC dissector in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not validate length
 values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted packet.
