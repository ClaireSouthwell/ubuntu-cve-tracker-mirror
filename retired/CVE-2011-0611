Description:
 Adobe Flash Player 10.2.153.1 and earlier for Windows, Macintosh, Linux,
 and Solaris; 10.2.154.25 and earlier for Chrome; and 10.2.156.12 and
 earlier for Android; Adobe AIR 2.6.19120 and earlier; and Authplay.dll (aka
 AuthPlayLib.bundle) in Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.x through 9.4.3 and 10.x
 through 10.0.2 on Windows and Mac OS X, allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted
 Flash content, related to a size inconsistency in a "group of included
 constants," object type confusion, and Date objects, as demonstrated by a
 .swf file embedded in a Microsoft Word document, and as exploited in the
 wild in April 2011.
