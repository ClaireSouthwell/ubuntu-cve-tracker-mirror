Description:
 An attacker who is able to spoof a packet with a correct origin
 timestamp before the expected response packet arrives at the target
 machine can send a CRYPTO_NAK or a bad MAC and cause the association's
 peer variables to be cleared. If this can be done often enough, it will
 prevent that association from working.
