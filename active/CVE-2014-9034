Description:
 Denial of service for giant passwords. This is the same issue as
 CVE-2014-9016 in Drupal, and was reported by the same individuals to
 both projects. The phpass library by Solar Designer was used in both
 projects without setting a maximum password length, which can lead to
 CPU exhaustion upon hashing.
