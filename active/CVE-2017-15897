Description:
 Node.js had a bug in versions 8.X and 9.X which caused buffers to not be
 initialized when the encoding for the fill value did not match the encoding
 specified. For example, 'Buffer.alloc(0x100, "This is not correctly
 encoded", "hex");' The buffer implementation was updated such that the
 buffer will be initialized to all zeros in these cases.
