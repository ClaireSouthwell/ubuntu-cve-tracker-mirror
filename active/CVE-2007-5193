Candidate: CVE-2007-5193
References:
Description:
 The default configuration for twiki 4.1.2 on Debian GNU/Linux, and possibly
 other operating systems, specifies the work area directory
 (cfg{RCS}{WorkAreaDir}) under the web document root, which might allow
 remote attackers to obtain sensitive information when .htaccess
 restrictions are not applied.
