Description:
 It has been discovered that lftp up to and including version 4.8.3 does not
 properly sanitize remote file names, leading to a loss of integrity on the
 local system when reverse mirroring is used. A remote attacker may trick a
 user to use reverse mirroring on an attacker controlled FTP server,
 resulting in the removal of all files in the current working directory of
 the victim's system.
