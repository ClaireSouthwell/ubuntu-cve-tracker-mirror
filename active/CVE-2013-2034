Description:
 This creates a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on Jenkins
 master, where an anonymous attacker can trick an administrator to execute
 arbitrary code on Jenkins master by having him open a specifically
 crafted attack URL. There's also a related vulnerability where the
 permission check on this ability is done imprecisely, which may affect
 those who are running Jenkins instances with a custom authorization
 strategy plugin.
