Description: 
 In releases krb5-1.9 and later, the KDC can crash due to a null
 pointer dereference in code that handles TGS (Ticket Granting Service)
 requests.  The trigger condition is trivial to produce using
 unmodified client software, but requires the ability to authenticate
 as a principal in the KDC's realm.
