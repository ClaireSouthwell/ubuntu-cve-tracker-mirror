Description: 
 A security flaw was found in the way the libsocialweb,
 a social network data aggregator, performed its initialization
 when this service start was initiated by the dbus daemon.
 Due to a deficiency in a way the libsocialweb service was
 initialized, an untrusted (non-SSL) network connection has
 been opened to remote Twitter service servers without explicit
 approval of the user, running the libsocialweb service on the
 local host. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
 various MITM attacks and potentially alter integrity of the user
 account in question.
