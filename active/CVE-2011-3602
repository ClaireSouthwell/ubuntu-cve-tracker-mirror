Description: 
 An arbitrary file overwrite flaw was found in radvd's
 set_interface_var() function, where it did not check the interface name
 (generated by the unprivileged user) and blindly overwrites a filename
 with a decimal value by the root process.  If a local attacker could
 create symlinks pointing to arbitrary files on the system, they could
 overwrite the target file contents.  If only radvd is compromised (e.g.
 no local access), the attacker may only overwrite files with specific
 names only (PROC_SYS_IP6_* from radvd's pathnames.h).
