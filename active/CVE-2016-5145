Description:
 Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.116, does not ensure that
 a taint property is preserved after a structure-clone operation on an
 ImageBitmap object derived from a cross-origin image, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via crafted JavaScript code.
