Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Mailman before
 2.1.10b1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
 unspecified vectors related to (1) editing templates and (2) the list's
 "info attribute" in the web administrator interface, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2006-3636.

Notes:
 jdstrand> from secure-testing:
   NOTE: Someone authenticated as list admin can insert malicious script
   NOTE: into list templates. This already consists of a high degree of
   NOTE: control over the mailinglist, so not a very important issue.
   NOTE: This enhances the fix for CVE-2006-3636.
