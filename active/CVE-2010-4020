Description:
 MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.8.x through 1.8.3 does not reject RC4
 key-derivation checksums, which might allow remote authenticated users to
 forge a (1) AD-SIGNEDPATH or (2) AD-KDC-ISSUED signature, and possibly gain
 privileges, by leveraging the small key space that results from certain
 one-byte stream-cipher operations.
