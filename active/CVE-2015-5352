Description:
 The x11_open_helper function in channels.c in ssh in OpenSSH before 6.9,
 when ForwardX11Trusted mode is not used, lacks a check of the refusal
 deadline for X connections, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
 bypass intended access restrictions via a connection outside of the
 permitted time window.
