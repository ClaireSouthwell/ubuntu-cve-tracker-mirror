Description:
 PEAR Archive_Tar version 1.4.3 and earlier contains a CWE-502, CWE-915
 vulnerability in the Archive_Tar class. There are several file operations
 with `$v_header['filename']` as parameter (such as file_exists, is_file,
 is_dir, etc). When extract is called without a specific prefix path, we can
 trigger unserialization by crafting a tar file with
 `phar://[path_to_malicious_phar_file]` as path. Object injection can be
 used to trigger destruct in the loaded PHP classes, e.g. the Archive_Tar
 class itself. With Archive_Tar object injection, arbitrary file deletion
 can occur because `@unlink($this->_temp_tarname)` is called. If another
 class with useful gadget is loaded, it may possible to cause remote code
 execution that can result in files being deleted or possibly modified. This
 vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.4.4.
