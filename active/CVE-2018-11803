Description: 
 Subversion 1.10.0 introduced server-side support for recursive directory
 listing operations. The implementation in mod_dav_svn failed to validate
 the root path of the directory listing provided by the client. If the
 client omits the root path, mod_dav_svn will deference an uninitialized
 pointer variable and crash the HTTPD worker process handling the request.
