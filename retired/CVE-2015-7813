Description:
 Xen 4.4.x, 4.5.x, and 4.6.x does not limit the number of printk console
 messages when reporting unimplemented hypercalls, which allows local guests
 to cause a denial of service via a sequence of (1) HYPERVISOR_physdev_op
 hypercalls, which are not properly handled in the do_physdev_op function in
 arch/arm/physdev.c, or (2) HYPERVISOR_hvm_op hypercalls, which are not
 properly handled in the do_hvm_op function in arch/arm/hvm.c.
