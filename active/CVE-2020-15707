Description: 
 Integer overflows were discovered in the functions grub_cmd_initrd
 and grub_initrd_init in the efilinux component of grub2, as shipped
 in Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu. These could be triggered by an
 extremely large number of arguments to the initrd command on 32-bit
 architectures, or a crafted filesystem with very large files on
 any architecture.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Colin Watson and Chris Coulson discovered that an integer overflow
 existed in GRUB2 when handling the initrd command, leading to a heap-based
 buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code
 and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.

 sbeattie| Title: grub2: integer overflows in efilinux grub_cmd_initrd
   and grub_initrd_init leads to heap based buffer overflow
 sbeattie| code is not upstream in grub2 but carried as part of patches
   by Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat and possibly others.
 amurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)
   and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low
