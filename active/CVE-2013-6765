Description:
 A software bug in OpenVAS Manager allowed an attacker to bypass the OMP
 authentication procedure. The attack vector was remotely available in
 case OpenVAS Manager was listening on a public network interface. In
 case of successful attack, the attacker gained partial rights to execute
 OMP commands. The bypass authentication was, however, incomplete and
 several OMP commands failed to execute properly.
