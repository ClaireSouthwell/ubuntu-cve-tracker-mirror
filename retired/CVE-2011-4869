Description:
 validator/val_nsec3.c in Unbound before 1.4.13p2 does not properly perform
 proof processing for NSEC3-signed zones, which allows remote DNS servers to
 cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a malformed response that
 lacks expected NSEC3 records, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4528.
