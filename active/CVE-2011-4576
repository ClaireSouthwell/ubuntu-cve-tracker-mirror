Description: 
 OpenSSL prior to 1.0.0f and 0.9.8s failed to clear the bytes used as
 block cipher padding in SSL 3.0 records. This affects both clients and
 servers that accept SSL 3.0 handshakes: those that call SSL_CTX_new with
 SSLv3_{server|client}_method or SSLv23_{server|client}_method. It does
 not affect TLS.
 As a result, in each record, up to 15 bytes of uninitialized memory
 may be sent, encrypted, to the SSL peer. This could include sensitive
 contents of previously freed memory.
