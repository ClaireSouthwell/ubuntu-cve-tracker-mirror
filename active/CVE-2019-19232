Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In Sudo through 1.8.29, an attacker with access to a Runas
 ALL sudoer account can impersonate a nonexistent user by invoking sudo with
 a numeric uid that is not associated with any user. NOTE: The software
 maintainer believes that this is not a vulnerability because running a
 command via sudo as a user not present in the local password database is an
 intentional feature. Because this behavior surprised some users, sudo
 1.8.30 introduced an option to enable/disable this behavior with the
 default being disabled. However, this does not change the fact that sudo
 was behaving as intended, and as documented, in earlier versions.
