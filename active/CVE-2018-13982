 https://github.com/sbaresearch/advisories/tree/public/2018/SBA-ADV-20180420-01_Smarty_Path_Traversal
Description:
 Smarty_Security::isTrustedResourceDir() in Smarty before 3.1.33 is prone to
 a path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient template code
 sanitization. This allows attackers controlling the executed template code
 to bypass the trusted directory security restriction and read arbitrary
 files.
