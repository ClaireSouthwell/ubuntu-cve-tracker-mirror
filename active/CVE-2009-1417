Description:
 gnutls-cli in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not verify the activation and
 expiration times of X.509 certificates, which allows remote attackers to
 successfully present a certificate that is (1) not yet valid or (2) no
 longer valid, related to lack of time checks in the
 _gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in
 libgnutls_x509, as used by (a) Exim, (b) OpenLDAP, and (c) libsoup.
