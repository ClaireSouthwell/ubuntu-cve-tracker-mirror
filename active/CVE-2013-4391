Description:
 An integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found
 in the way journald functionality of systemd, a system and service
 manager, processed native messages. A remote attacker could provide a
 specially-crafted packet that when processed by systemd would lead to
 systemd daemon crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the
 privileges of the user running the daemon.
