Description:
 The opus_packet_get_samples_per_frame function in client in Mumble 1.2.4
 and the 1.2.3 pre-release snapshots allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (crash) via a crafted length prefix value, which triggers
 a NULL pointer dereference or a heap-based buffer over-read (aka
 "out-of-bounds array access").
