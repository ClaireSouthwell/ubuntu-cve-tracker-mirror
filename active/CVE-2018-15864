Description:
 Unchecked NULL pointer usage in resolve_keysym in xkbcomp/parser.y in
 xkbcommon before 0.8.2 could be used by local attackers to crash (NULL
 pointer dereference) the xkbcommon parser by supplying a crafted keymap
 file, because a map access attempt can occur for a map that was never
 created.
