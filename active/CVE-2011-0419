Description: 
 A flaw was found in the APR library, which could be exploited through Apache
 HTTPD's mod_autoindex. If a directory indexed by mod_autoindex contained files
 with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted
 request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial
 of service attack.
