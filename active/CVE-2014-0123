Description:
 The wiki subsystem in Moodle through 2.3.11, 2.4.x before 2.4.9, 2.5.x
 before 2.5.5, and 2.6.x before 2.6.2 does not properly restrict (1) view
 and (2) edit access, which allows remote authenticated users to perform
 wiki operations by leveraging the student role and using the Recent
 Activity block to reach the individual wiki of an arbitrary student.
