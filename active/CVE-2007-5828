Candidate: CVE-2007-5828
References:
Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the
 admin panel in Django 0.96 allows remote attackers to change passwords of
 arbitrary users via a request to admin/auth/user/1/password/.  NOTE: this
 issue has been disputed by Debian, since product documentation includes a
 recommendation for a CSRF protection module that is included with the
 product.  However, CVE considers this an issue because the default
 configuration does not use this module.
