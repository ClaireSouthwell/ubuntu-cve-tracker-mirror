Description:
 Nagios Core through 4.3.4 initially executes /usr/sbin/nagios as root but
 supports configuration options in which this file is owned by a non-root
 account (and similarly can have nagios.cfg owned by a non-root account),
 which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to this
 non-root account.
