Candidate: CVE-2009-0163

Description: 
 In CUPS 1.3.9 and prior, the filter "imagetops" is vulnerable to an integer 
 overflow that can lead to a heap based buffer overflow.  The vulnerable 
 code exists in the "_cupsImageReadTIFF()" function.  This issue may be 
 triggered by remote clients able to print via a CUPS server.  Successfully 
 exploiting this issue may result in execution of arbitrary commands with 
 the privileges that CUPS is configured to use when running CGI programs.  
 The default user is "lp".  This update addresses the issue through improved 
 bounds checking. Mac OS X systems leverage a system library to handle TIFF 
 files and are not vulnerable to this issue.

 jdstrand> without a reproducer, AFAICS cups with libtiff should be vulnerable
  as libtiff doesn't error out on images with a height (ImageLength) larger
  than 0x3fffffff (2^30-1)
