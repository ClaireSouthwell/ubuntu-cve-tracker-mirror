Description:
 dpkg-source in dpkg 1.3.0 through 1.18.23 is able to use a non-GNU patch
 program and does not offer a protection mechanism for blank-indented diff
 hunks, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks
 via a crafted Debian source package, as demonstrated by use of dpkg-source
 on NetBSD.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This only affects operating systems that don't use GNU patch
 mdeslaur> by default, which isn't the case on Debian/Ubuntu. Setting
 mdeslaur> priority to negligible.
