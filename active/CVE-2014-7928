Description:
 hydrogen.cc in Google V8, as used Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, does
 not properly handle arrays with holes, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via crafted JavaScript code that triggers an array copy.
