Description:
 Tero Marttila discovered that the Debian packaging for smokeping
 installed it in such a way that the CGI implementation of Apache httpd
 (mod_cgi) passed additional arguments to the smokeping_cgi program,
 potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in response to crafted
 HTTP requests.
