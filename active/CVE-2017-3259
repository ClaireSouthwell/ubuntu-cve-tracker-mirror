Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 Deployment). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u131,
 7u121 and 8u112. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows
 unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
 compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible data.
 Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in
 clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
 applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from
 the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
 vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
 that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
 administrator).
