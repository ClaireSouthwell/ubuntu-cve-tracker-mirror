Description: 
 Swift uses pickle to store and load meta data and serialization in memcached
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes:
 jdstrand> design problem which requires access to the private swift network.
  Memcached portion is fixed upstream but adds a configuration option that
  defaults to using pickle serialization since not all memcached servers
  understand JSON.
 jdstrand> Marking as 'low' since this requires privileged network access
  (per upstream)
