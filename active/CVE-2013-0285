Description:
 The nori gem 2.0.x before 2.0.2, 1.1.x before 1.1.4, and 1.0.x before 1.0.3
 for Ruby does not properly restrict casts of string values, which allows
 remote attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary
 code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) involving
 nested XML entity references, by leveraging Action Pack support for (1)
 YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion, a similar vulnerability
 to CVE-2013-0156.
