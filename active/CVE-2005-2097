Candidate: CVE-2005-2097
References:
Description:
 xpdf and kpdf do not properly validate the "loca" table in PDF files, which
 allows local users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption and hang)
 via a PDF file with a "broken" loca table, which causes a large temporary
 file to be created when xpdf attempts to reconstruct the information.
