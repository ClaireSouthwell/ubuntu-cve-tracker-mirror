Description:
 Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.116, does not properly
 implement lazy deoptimization, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via crafted JavaScript code, as demonstrated by improper handling of
 a heap allocation of a number outside the Small Integer (aka smi) range.
