Description:
 DokuWiki 2009-12-25c allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information via a direct request to a .php file, which reveals the
 installation path in an error message, as demonstrated by lib/tpl/index.php
 and certain other files.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> Minimal diff between lib/tpl/index.php in 0.0.20091225c-3 and
 tyhicks> 0.0.20110525a-2, so I'm marking oneiric as needed.
