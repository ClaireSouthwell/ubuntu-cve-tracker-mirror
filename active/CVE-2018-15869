Description:
 An Amazon Web Services (AWS) developer who does not specify the --owners
 flag when describing images via AWS CLI, and therefore not properly
 validating source software per AWS recommended security best practices, may
 unintentionally load an undesired and potentially malicious Amazon Machine
 Image (AMI) from the uncurated public community AMI catalog.
