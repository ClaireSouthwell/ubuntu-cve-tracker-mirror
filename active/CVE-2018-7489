Description:
 FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.8.11.1 and 2.9.x before 2.9.5 allows
 unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the
 CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is exploitable by sending
 maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper,
 bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the c3p0 libraries are
 available in the classpath.
