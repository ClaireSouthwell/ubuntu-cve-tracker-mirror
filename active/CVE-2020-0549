Description: 
 On some processors under certain microarchitectural conditions, data
 from the most recently evicted modified L1 data cache (L1D) line may
 be propagated into an unused (invalid) L1D fill buffer. On processors
 affected by Microarchitectural Data Samping (MDS) or Transactional
 Asynchronous Abort (TAA), data from an L1D fill buffer may be inferred
 using one of these data sampling side channel methods. By combining
 these two behaviors together, it may be possible for a malicious actor
 to infer data values from modified cache lines that were previously
 evicted from the L1 data cache. This is called L1D eviction sampling.
