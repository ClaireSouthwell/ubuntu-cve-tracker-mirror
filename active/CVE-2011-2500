Description: 
 A flaw was found in the way nfs-utils performed IP based authentication of
 mount requests. In configurations where a directory was exported to a group
 of systems using a DNS wildcard or NIS (Network Information Service)
 netgroup, an attacker could possibly gain access to other directories
 exported to a specific host or subnet, bypassing intended access
 restrictions.
