Description: 
 This sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the server. Since the RFC
 requires that the server reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame,
 an empty SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a
 ping. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume
 excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a
 Denial-of-Service. Also known as "HTTP/2 Settings Flood".
