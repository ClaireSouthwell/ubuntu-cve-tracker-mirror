Description:
 In 389-ds-base up to version 1.4.1.2, requests are handled by workers
 threads. Each sockets will be waited by the worker for at most
 'ioblocktimeout' seconds. However this timeout applies only for
 un-encrypted requests. Connections using SSL/TLS are not taking this
 timeout into account during reads, and may hang longer.An unauthenticated
 attacker could repeatedly create hanging LDAP requests to hang all the
 workers, resulting in a Denial of Service.
