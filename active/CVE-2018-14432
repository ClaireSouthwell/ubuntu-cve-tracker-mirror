Description:
 In the Federation component of OpenStack Keystone before 11.0.4, 12.0.0,
 and 13.0.0, an authenticated "GET /v3/OS-FEDERATION/projects" request may
 bypass intended access restrictions on listing projects. An authenticated
 user may discover projects they have no authority to access, leaking all
 projects in the deployment and their attributes. Only Keystone with the
 /v3/OS-FEDERATION endpoint enabled via policy.json is affected.
