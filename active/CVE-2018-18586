Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** chmextract.c in the chmextract sample program, as
 distributed with libmspack before 0.8alpha, does not protect against
 absolute/relative pathnames in CHM files, leading to Directory Traversal.
 NOTE: the vendor disputes that this is a libmspack vulnerability, because
 chmextract.c was only intended as a source-code example, not a supported
 application.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> clamav in xenial+ uses the system libmspack, trusty uses
 mdeslaur> the embedded one.
