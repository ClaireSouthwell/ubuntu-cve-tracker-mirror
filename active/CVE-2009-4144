Description:
 NetworkManager (NM) 0.7.2 does not ensure that the configured Certification
 Authority (CA) certificate file for a (1) WPA Enterprise or (2) 802.1x
 network remains present upon a connection attempt, which might allow remote
 attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service
 (connectivity disruption) by spoofing the identity of a wireless network.
