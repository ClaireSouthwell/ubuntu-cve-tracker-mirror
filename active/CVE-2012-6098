Description:
 grade/edit/outcome/edit_form.php in Moodle 1.9.x through 1.9.19, 2.1.x
 before 2.1.10, 2.2.x before 2.2.7, 2.3.x before 2.3.4, and 2.4.x before
 2.4.1 does not properly enforce the moodle/grade:manage capability
 requirement, which allows remote authenticated users to convert custom
 outcomes into standard site-wide outcomes by leveraging the teacher role
 and using the re-editing feature.
