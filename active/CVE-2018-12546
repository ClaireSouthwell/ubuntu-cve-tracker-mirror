Description:
 If a client publishes a retained message to a topic that they have access
 to, and then their access to that topic is revoked, the retained message
 will still be delivered to future subscribers. This behaviour may be
 undesirable in some applications, so a configuration option
 `check_retain_source` has been introduced to enforce checking of the
 retained message source on publish.
