Description:
 nbd-server has the ability to deny connection requests to clients unless
 their IP addresses are listed in a tcpwrappers-style configuration file.
 Due to incorrect use of strncmp() in the parser for this file, however,
 it would allow clients to connect so long as their IP address in ASCII
 representation would start with something in the ACL file; e.g.,
 198.51.100.12 would be allowed if 198.51.100.1 was listed.
