Description:
 An issue was discovered in icoutils 0.31.1. A buffer overflow was observed
 in the "decode_ne_resource_id" function in the "restable.c" source file.
 This is happening because the "len" parameter for memcpy is not checked for
 size and thus becomes a negative integer in the process, resulting in a
 failed memcpy. This affects wrestool.
