Description:
 When ntpd receives a server response on a socket that corresponds to a
 different interface than was used for the request, the peer structure
 is updated to use the interface for new requests. If ntpd is running on
 a host with multiple interfaces in separate networks and the operating
 system doesn't check source address in received packets (e.g. rp_filter
 on Linux is set to 0), an attacker that knows the address of the source
 can send a packet with spoofed source address which will cause ntpd to
 select wrong interface for the source and prevent it from sending new
 requests until the list of interfaces is refreshed
