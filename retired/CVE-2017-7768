Description:
 The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to
 read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the
 service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows
 Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access,
 bypassing system protections against unprivileged users. Note: This attack
 requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating
 systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.2 and
 Firefox < 54.
