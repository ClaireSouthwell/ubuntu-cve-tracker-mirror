Description:
 libcurl's (new) internal function that returns a 32bit random value overwrote
 the pointer. This random value is used to generate nonces for Digest and NTLM
 authentication, for generating boundary strings in HTTP formposts and more.
 Having a weak or virtually non-existent random there makes these operations
 vulnerable. This function is brand new in 7.52.0.
