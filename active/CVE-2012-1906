Description: 
 [#13260] - appdmg and pkgdmg providers write packages to insecure location
 If a remote source is given for a package, the package is downloaded to a
 predictable filename in /tmp.  It is possible to create a symlink at this name
 and use it to clobber any file on the system, or by switching the symlink
 install arbitrary packages (and package installers can execute arbitrary code).
