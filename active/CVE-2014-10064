Description:
 The qs module before 1.0.0 does not have an option or default for
 specifying object depth and when parsing a string representing a deeply
 nested object will block the event loop for long periods of time. An
 attacker could leverage this to cause a temporary denial-of-service
 condition, for example, in a web application, other requests would not be
 processed while this blocking is occurring.
