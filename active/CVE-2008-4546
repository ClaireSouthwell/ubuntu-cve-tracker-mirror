Description:
 Adobe Flash Player 9.0.45.0, 9.0.112.0, 9.0.124.0, and 10.0.12.10 allows
 remote web servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
 and browser crash) by returning a different response when an HTTP request
 is sent a second time, as demonstrated by two responses that provide SWF
 files with different SWF version numbers.
