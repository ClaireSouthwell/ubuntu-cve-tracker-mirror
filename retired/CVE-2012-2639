Description:
 The list_directory function in Lib/SimpleHTTPServer.py in SimpleHTTPServer
 in Python before 2.5.6c1, 2.6.x before 2.6.7 rc2, and 2.7.x before 2.7.2
 does not place a charset parameter in the Content-Type HTTP header, which
 makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
 attacks against Internet Explorer 7 via UTF-7 encoding.
