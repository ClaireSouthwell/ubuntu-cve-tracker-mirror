Description:
 CgiUserConfigEdit in BackupPC 3.1.0, when SSH keys and Rsync are in use in
 a multi-user environment, does not restrict users from the ClientNameAlias
 function, which allows remote authenticated users to read and write
 sensitive files by modifying ClientNameAlias to match another system, then
 initiating a backup or restore.
