Description:
 A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW Beast front-end handles unexpected
 disconnect. An authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw by making
 multiple attempts of disconnect resulting in permanent leak of a socket
 connection by radosgw.  This flaw could lead to a denial of service
 condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually leading to the
 exhaustion of available resources and preventing legitimate users from
 connecting to the system.
