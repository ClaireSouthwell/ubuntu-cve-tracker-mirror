Description:
 The default soap.wsdl_cache_dir setting in (1) php.ini-production and (2)
 php.ini-development in PHP through 5.6.7 specifies the /tmp directory,
 which makes it easier for local users to conduct WSDL injection attacks by
 creating a file under /tmp with a predictable filename that is used by the
 get_sdl function in ext/soap/php_sdl.c.
