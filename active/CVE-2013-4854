Description: 
 A specially crafted query that includes malformed rdata can cause named to
 terminate with an assertion failure while rejecting the malformed query.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sarnold> The patched function findnoqname() in lib/dns/resolver.c
  does not exist in any shipped Ubuntu bind9 packages. Manual inspection
  of the three call-sites of the added function shows those blocks of code
  do not have analogues in any Ubuntu bind9 packages. I do not know the
  consequences of not having those blocks of code but it would likely
  show trouble only if DNSSEC validation is being performed.
