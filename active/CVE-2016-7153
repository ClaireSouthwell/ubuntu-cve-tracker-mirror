Description:
 The HTTP/2 protocol does not consider the role of the TCP congestion window
 in providing information about content length, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to obtain cleartext data by leveraging a web-browser
 configuration in which third-party cookies are sent, aka a "HEIST" attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> NVD had this CVE assigned to multiple browers as of 2016-09-12.
  This CVE appears to cover a wide variety of browser side channels
  demonstrating the time difference between first byte and last byte in
  a response. This can be used both for compression-based determinations
  of exact strings from requests that are reflected in responses as well
  as uncompressed responses from sites that have disabled compression
  to mitigate BEAST or CRIME.
 sarnold> The paper authors recommend users disable third-party cookies
  in their browsers, with the caveat that many services will break.
