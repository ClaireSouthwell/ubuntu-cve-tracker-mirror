Description:
 Leptonica before 1.75.3 does not limit the number of characters in a %s
 format argument to fscanf or sscanf, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by the
 gplotRead and ptaReadStream functions.
