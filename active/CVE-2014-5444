Description:
 When geary gets a certificate error (self-signed certificate), it'll
 log that to console when starting with --debug, but the window will
 just continue loading without getting an error. Geary should open a
 window with the error, certificate information (checksum etc) and the
 possibility to permanently accept the certificate. There should also
 be the possibility to remove the permanently accepted certificates.
