 http://drupal.org/node/1557938
Description: 
 Drupal core's text filtering system provides several features including
 removing inappropriate HTML tags and automatically linking content that
 appears to be a link. A pattern in Drupal's text matching was found to be
 inefficient with certain specially crafted strings. This vulnerability is
 mitigated by the fact that users must have the ability to post content
 sent to the filter system such as a role with the "post comments" or
 "Forum topic: Create new content" permission.
