Description: 
 A cross-site scripting bug in the CUPS templating engine allows this bug
 to be exploited when a user browses the web. This XSS is reachable in
 the default configuration for Linux instances of CUPS, and allows an
 attacker to bypass default configuration settings that bind the CUPS
 scheduler to the localhost or loopback interface.
