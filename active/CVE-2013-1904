Description:
 A local file inclusion flaw was found in the way RoundCube Webmail,
 a browser-based multilingual IMAP client, performed validation of the
 'generic_message_footer' value provided via web user interface in certain
 circumstances. A remote attacker could issue a specially-crafted request
 that, when processed by RoundCube Webmail could allow an attacker to
 obtain arbitrary file on the system, accessible with the privileges of
 the user running RoundCube Webmail client.
