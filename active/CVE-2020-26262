Description:
 By default coturn does not allow peers to connect and relay packets to
 loopback addresses in the range of `127.x.x.x`. However, it was observed that
 when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of
 `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently,
 `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then is able to
 relay packets to the loopback interface.
 Additionally, when coturn is listening on IPv6, which is default, the loopback
 interface can also be reached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the
 peer address.
