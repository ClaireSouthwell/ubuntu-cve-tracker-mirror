Candidate: CVE-2006-6077
References:
Description:
 The (1) Password Manager in Mozilla Firefox 2.0, and 1.5.0.8 and earlier;
 and the (2) Passcard Manager in Netscape 8.1.2 and possibly other versions,
 do not properly verify that an ACTION URL in a FORM element containing a
 password INPUT element matches the web site for which the user stored a
 password, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a password
 INPUT element on a different web page located on the web site intended for
 this password.
