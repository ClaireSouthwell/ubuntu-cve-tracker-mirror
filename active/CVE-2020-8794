Description:
 OpenSMTPD before 6.6.4 allows remote code execution because of an
 out-of-bounds read in mta_io in mta_session.c for multi-line replies.
 Although this vulnerability affects the client side of OpenSMTPD, it is
 possible to attack a server because the server code launches the client
 code during bounce handling.
