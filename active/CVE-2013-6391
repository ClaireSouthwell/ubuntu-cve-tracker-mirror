Description:
 By generating EC2 credentials using a trust-scoped token, a trustee may
 retrieve a token not scoped to the trust, therefore elevating privileges
 to all of the trustor's roles. Only Keystone setups enabling EC2-style
 authentication are affected.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per upstream, Ubuntu 13.04 not affected due to improper check which
  disables impersonation entirely. Upstream has not released a patch yet for
  grizzly (Ubuntu 13.04) as of 2013-12-17. A fix for Ubuntu 13.04 may happen
  in a future update.
