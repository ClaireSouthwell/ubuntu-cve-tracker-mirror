Description:
 During code migration a bug was introduced in PolarSSL 0.99-pre4. As a
 result the generation of Diffie Hellman value X is weak on the client
 and server. Only a part of the value X is filled with random data,
 instead of the whole value. (Determined by the server Diffie Hellman
 parameters). In addition, MPI primes are only generated within a
 limited subspace of the full prime space. Again only a part of the
 prime is filled with random data, instead of the whole value.
