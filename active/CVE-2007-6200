Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in rsync before 3.0.0pre6, when running a
 writable rsync daemon, allows remote attackers to bypass exclude,
 exclude_from, and filter and read or write hidden files via (1) symlink,
 (2) partial-dir, (3) backup-dir, and unspecified (4) dest options.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> lowering priority as it is only for rsyncd.  This is a non-standard
   configuration. There is currently no patch (though it seems one is being
   worked on), but there is a workaround: use this in rsyncd.conf:
     refuse options = --*-dest --partial-dir --backup-dir
   Should have a man page update is pushing this out without a patch
