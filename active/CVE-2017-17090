Description:
 An issue was discovered in chan_skinny.c in Asterisk Open Source 13.18.2
 and older, 14.7.2 and older, and 15.1.2 and older, and Certified Asterisk
 13.13-cert7 and older. If the chan_skinny (aka SCCP protocol) channel

 to use excessive amounts of virtual memory, eventually causing asterisk to
 stop processing requests of any kind.
