Candidate: CVE-2005-1768
References:
Description:
 Race condition in the ia32 compatibility code for the execve system call in
 Linux kernel 2.4 before 2.4.31 and 2.6 before 2.6.6 allows local users to
 cause a denial of service (kernel panic) and possibly execute arbitrary
 code via a concurrent thread that increments a pointer count after the
 nargs function has counted the pointers, but before the count is copied
 from user space to kernel space, which leads to a buffer overflow.
