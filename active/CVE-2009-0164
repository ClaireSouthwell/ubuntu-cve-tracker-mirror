Description: 
 The Web Interface of CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier may be subject to DNS  
 rebinding attacks.  This update provides Host header validation for the 
 CUPS Web Interface and an additional configuration directive (ServerAlias) 
 for the CUPS configuration file so that administrators can mitigate 
 rebinding attacks.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 kees> cups/CVE-2009-0164.patch
 jdstrand> patch is large, could break existing configurations if the
  auto-discovery of alternate names does not work (eg, with CNAMES), and
  requires a coordinated attack. The vulnerability appears to be mostly
  information leakage, but might also allow starting and stopping of
  printers. An attacker trying to perform actions via the web interface should
  be challenged by the authentication system. The new ServerAlias directive
  will be a part of 1.3.10.
