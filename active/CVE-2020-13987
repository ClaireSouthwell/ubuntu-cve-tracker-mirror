Description: 
 When calculating the checksum for IP data, the function
 upper_layer_chksum() doesn’t check the validity of the length
 field of the upper layer (TCP/UDP) segment against the length of
 the internal buffer uip_buf . That would result eventually into an
 Out of bounds read bug which might result in a crash DoS. The crash
 depends on how the platform implements memory protection and the
 out of bound read’s size.
