Description:
 PHP through 5.6.27 and 7.x through 7.0.12 mishandles property modification
 during __wakeup processing, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted serialized
 data, as demonstrated by Exception::__toString with DateInterval::__wakeup.

 mdeslaur> that was fixed in the same bug. This CVE is for the remaining
 mdeslaur> security problem associated with __wakeup, which, as far as I
 mdeslaur> can tell is still unfixed as of 2018-03-09
