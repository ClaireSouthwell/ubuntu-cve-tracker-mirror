Description:
 A flaw was found in the way Qt handled X.509 certificates with IP address
 wildcards. An attacker able to obtain a certificate with a Common Name
 containing an IP wildcard could possibly use this flaw to impersonate an
 SSL server to client applications that are using Qt. This update also
 introduces more strict handling for hostname wildcard certificates by
 disallowing the wildcard character to match more than one hostname
 component.
