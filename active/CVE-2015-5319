Description:
 When creating a job using the create-job CLI command, external entities are
 not discarded (nor processed). If these job configurations are processed by
 another user with an XML-aware tool (e.g. using get-job/update-job),
 information from that user's computer may be disclosed to Jenkins and the
 attacker.
