Description:
 In Horde_Crypt before 2.7.6, as used in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 5.x
 through 5.2.17, OS Command Injection can occur if the user has PGP features
 enabled in the user's preferences, and has enabled the "Should PGP signed
 messages be automatically verified when viewed?" preference. To exploit
 this vulnerability, an attacker can send a PGP signed email (that is
 maliciously crafted) to the Horde user, who then must either view or
 preview it.
