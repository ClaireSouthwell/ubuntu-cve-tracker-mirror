Description:
 Users with Overall/Read permission were able to access the URL used to
 cancel scheduled restart jobs initiated via the update center ("Restart
 Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running") due to
 a lack of permission checks.
 Access to the affected URL is now limited to users with
 Overall/Administer permission.
