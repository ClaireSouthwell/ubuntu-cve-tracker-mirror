Description:
 Due to the way that Rack::Request and Rails::Request interact, it
 is possible for a 3rd party or custom rack middleware to parse the
 parameters insecurely and store them in the same key that Rails uses
 for its own parameters.  In the event that happens the application
 will receive unsafe parameters and could be vulnerable to the earlier
 vulnerability.
