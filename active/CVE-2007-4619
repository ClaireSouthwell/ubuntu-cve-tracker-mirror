Candidate: CVE-2007-4619
References:
Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) libFLAC
 before 1.2.1, as used in Winamp before 5.5 and other products, allow
 user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed
 FLAC file that triggers improper memory allocation, resulting in a
 heap-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> fixed in RedHat flac-1.1.2-28.el5_0.1.src.rpm
 jdstrand> preliminary analysis shows that xine-lib is probably not affected
   (only 1 call to realloc and 4 calls to xine_xmalloc).  The code is quite
   different, so need to dive in more.
 jdstrand> requested reproducer on vendor-sec (they said no, but there is a
   good test suite)
 jdstrand> Debian 1.2.1-1 in unstable is not affected
