Description:
 Kornel Lesinski reported a significant security problem with Mantis'
 handling of attachments and MIME types. A user could upload a HTML file
 renamed to .gif and MantisBT would use Fileinfo to calculate the actual
 MIME type to be text/html. This is a problem because a user could be
 directed to click on a link purporting to be a .gif attachment when in
 fact it is a HTML document. Browsers would attempt to render the
 text/html attachment within the browser instead of treating it as a
 file download (or even just plaintext).
