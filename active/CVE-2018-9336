Description:
 openvpnserv.exe (aka the interactive service helper) in OpenVPN 2.4.x
 before 2.4.6 allows a local attacker to cause a double-free of memory by
 sending a malformed request to the interactive service. This could cause a
 denial-of-service through memory corruption or possibly have unspecified
 other impact including privilege escalation.
