Description:
 The Node.js inspector, in 6.x and later is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding
 attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack
 is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same
 computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running
 the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack
 to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow
 HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a
 Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a
 host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a
 debugger, and get full code execution access.
