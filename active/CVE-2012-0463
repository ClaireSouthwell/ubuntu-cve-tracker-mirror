Description:
 The nsWindow implementation in the browser engine in Mozilla Firefox before
 3.6.28 and 4.x through 10.0, Firefox ESR 10.x before 10.0.3, Thunderbird
 before 3.1.20 and 5.0 through 10.0, Thunderbird ESR 10.x before 10.0.3, and
 SeaMonkey before 2.8 does not check the validity of an instance after event
 dispatching, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
 code via unknown vectors, as demonstrated by Mobile Firefox on Android.
