Description:
 CUPS 1.4.4, when running in certain Linux distributions such as Debian
 GNU/Linux, stores the web interface administrator key in
 /var/run/cups/certs/0 using certain permissions, which allows local users
 in the lpadmin group to read or write arbitrary files as root by leveraging
 the web interface.
