Description:
 The Verify function in crypto/dsa/dsa.go in Go before 1.5.4 and 1.6.x
 before 1.6.1 does not properly check parameters passed to the big integer
 library, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (infinite loop) via a crafted public key to a program that uses HTTPS
 client certificates or SSH server libraries.
