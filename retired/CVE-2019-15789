Description:
 MicroK8s prior to v1.15.3 included a privilege escalation vulnerability,
 allowing a low privilege user to obtain root access to the host. MicroK8s
 allowed any user with access to the host to administer the underlying
 Kubernetes installation, including deploy pods. This allowed an attacker
 with local access to provision a privileged container and gain root access
 to the underlying host.
