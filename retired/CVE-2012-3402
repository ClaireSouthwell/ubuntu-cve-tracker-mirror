Description: 
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Adobe Photoshop(tm) PSD plug-in
 of Gimp, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, performed decoding of headers, when loading
 certain Adobe Photoshop image files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
 PSD image file that, when opened in Gimp would lead to PSD plug-in crash or, potentially,
 arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gimp executable.
  
 Note: A different flaw than CVE-2009-3909.
