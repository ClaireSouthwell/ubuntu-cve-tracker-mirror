Description:
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.34, by sending continuous, large
 SETTINGS frames a client can occupy a connection, server thread and CPU
 time without any connection timeout coming to effect. This affects only
 HTTP/2 connections. A possible mitigation is to not enable the h2 protocol.

 mdeslaur> artful and older don't enable http2 in the build.
