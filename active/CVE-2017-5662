Description:
 Files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can be revealed
 to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that
 can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application
 is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server--including
 confidential or sensitive files--would be possible. XXE can also be used to
 attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references
 within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.
