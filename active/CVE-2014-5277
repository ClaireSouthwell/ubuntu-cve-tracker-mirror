Description:
 Docker before 1.3.1 and docker-py before 0.5.3 fall back to HTTP when the
 HTTPS connection to the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to conduct downgrade attacks and obtain authentication and image
 data by leveraging a network position between the client and the registry
 to block HTTPS traffic.
