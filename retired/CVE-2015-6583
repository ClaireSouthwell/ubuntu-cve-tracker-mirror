Description:
 Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85 does not display a location bar for a
 hosted app's window after navigation away from the installation site, which
 might make it easier for remote attackers to spoof content via a crafted
 app, related to browser.cc and hosted_app_browser_controller.cc.
