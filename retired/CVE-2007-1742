Candidate: CVE-2007-1742
References: 
Description:
 suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3 uses a partial comparison for
 verifying whether the current directory is within the document root, which
 might allow local users to perform unauthorized operations on incorrect
 directories, as demonstrated using "html_backup" and "htmleditor" under an
 "html" directory.  NOTE: the researcher, who is reliable, claims that the
 vendor disputes the issue because "the attacks described rely on an
 insecure server configuration" in which the user "has write access to the
 document root."
