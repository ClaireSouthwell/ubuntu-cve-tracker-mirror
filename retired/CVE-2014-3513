Description: 
 A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who
 sends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail
 to free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be
 exploited in a Denial Of Service attack. This issue affects OpenSSL
 1.0.1 server implementations for both SSL/TLS and DTLS regardless of
 whether SRTP is used or configured. Implementations of OpenSSL that
 have been compiled with OPENSSL_NO_SRTP defined are not affected.
