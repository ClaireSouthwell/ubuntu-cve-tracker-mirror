Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to spoof the
 contents of the status bar via a link to a data: URI containing an encoded
 URL.  NOTE: the severity of this issue has been disputed by a reliable
 third party, since the intended functionality of the status bar allows it
 to be modified.
