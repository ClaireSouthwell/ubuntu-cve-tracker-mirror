Description:
 The (1) sqlite_single_query and (2) sqlite_array_query functions in
 ext/sqlite/sqlite.c in PHP 5.2 through 5.2.13 and 5.3 through 5.3.2 allow
 context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code by calling these
 functions with an empty SQL query, which triggers access of uninitialized
 memory.
