Description:
 With a crafted username or a table name, it was possible to inject SQL
 statements in the tracking functionality that would run with the privileges of
 the control user. This gives read and write access to the tables of the
 configuration storage database, and if the control user has the necessary
 privileges, read access to some tables of the mysql database.
