Description:
 The TIFFVStripSize function in tif_strip.c in LibTIFF 3.9.0 and 3.9.2 makes
 incorrect calls to the TIFFGetField function, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted TIFF image,
 related to "downsampled OJPEG input" and possibly related to a compiler
 optimization that triggers a divide-by-zero error.
