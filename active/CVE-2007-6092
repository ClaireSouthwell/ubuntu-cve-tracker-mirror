 whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> according to http://bugs.digium.com/view.php?id=5413#39752, Ingate's
   libsrtp is based on Cisco's libsrtp (which is what is in universe).  This
   lib is BSD licensed and I can't find Ingate's source.  As such, I am leaving
   this as 'needs-triage'
