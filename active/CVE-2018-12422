Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** addressbook/backends/ldap/e-book-backend-ldap.c in
 Evolution-Data-Server in GNOME Evolution through 3.29.2 might allow
 attackers to trigger a Buffer Overflow via a long query that is processed
 by the strcat function. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes this because
 "the code had computed the required string length first, and then allocated
 a large-enough buffer on the heap."

Notes:
 mdeslaur> upstream developer disputes this issue, and has filed a claim
 mdeslaur> to reject the CVE. Deferring for now.
