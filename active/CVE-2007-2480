Candidate: CVE-2007-2480
References: 
Description: 
 The _udp_lib_get_port function in net/ipv4/udp.c in Linux kernel 2.6.21 and
 earlier does not prevent a bind to a port with a local address when there is
 already a bind to that port with a wildcard local address, which might allow
 local users to intercept local traffic for daemons or other applications.
