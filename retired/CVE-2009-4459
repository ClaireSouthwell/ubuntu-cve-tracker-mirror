Description:
 Redmine 0.8.7 and earlier uses the title tag before defining the character
 encoding in a meta tag, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
 scripting (XSS) attacks and inject arbitrary script via UTF-7 encoded
 values in the title parameter to a new issue page, which may be interpreted
 as script by Internet Explorer 7 and 8.
