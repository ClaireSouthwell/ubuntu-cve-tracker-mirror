Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Twig before 2.4.4 allows Server-Side Template Injection
 (SSTI) via the search search_key parameter. NOTE: the vendor points out
 that Twig itself is not a web application and states that it is the
 responsibility of web applications using Twig to properly wrap input to it.
