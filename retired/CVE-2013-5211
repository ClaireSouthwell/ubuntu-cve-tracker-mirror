Description:
 The monlist feature in ntp_request.c in ntpd in NTP before 4.2.7p26 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via
 forged (1) REQ_MON_GETLIST or (2) REQ_MON_GETLIST_1 requests, as exploited
 in the wild in December 2013.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> default ntp.conf in Ubuntu contains noquery, so monlist is
 mdeslaur> disabled by default. Sites that need monlist should restrict it
 mdeslaur> from known trusted IPs. Upstream has removed monlist in favour
 mdeslaur> of mrulist. This is too intrusive to backport, so we're going to
 mdeslaur> ignore this.
