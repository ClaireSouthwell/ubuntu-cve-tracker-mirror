Description:
 fileio.c in Vim prior to 8.0.1263 sets the group ownership of a .swp file
 to the editor's primary group (which may be different from the group
 ownership of the original file), which allows local users to obtain
 sensitive information by leveraging an applicable group membership, as
 demonstrated by /etc/shadow owned by root:shadow mode 0640, but
 /etc/.shadow.swp owned by root:users mode 0640, a different vulnerability
 than CVE-2017-1000382.
