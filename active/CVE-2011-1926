Description:
 The STARTTLS implementation in Cyrus IMAP Server before 2.4.7 does not
 properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
 to insert commands into encrypted sessions by sending a cleartext command
 that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext command
 injection" attack, a similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.
