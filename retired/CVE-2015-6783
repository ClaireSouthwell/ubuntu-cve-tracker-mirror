Description:
 The FindStartOffsetOfFileInZipFile function in crazy_linker_zip.cpp in
 crazy_linker (aka Crazy Linker) in Android 5.x and 6.x, as used in Google
 Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, improperly searches for an EOCD record, which
 allows attackers to bypass a signature-validation requirement via a crafted
 ZIP archive.
