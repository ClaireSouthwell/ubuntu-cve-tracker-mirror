Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect
 input validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in
 Denial of Service to all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to
 this vulnerability occurring before normal security checks; any remote
 client that can reach the proxy port can trivially perform the attack via a
 crafted URI scheme.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> same fix as CVE-2019-12523
 mdeslaur> This was fixed in 4.x by rewriting the URI parser to use SBuf.
 mdeslaur> Backporting the 4.x commit to 3.x is problematic.
 mdeslaur> As of 2020-02-07, no backport to 3.x is available, and no
 mdeslaur> details or reproducer for the issue is available to develop a
 mdeslaur> specific fix for 3.x.
