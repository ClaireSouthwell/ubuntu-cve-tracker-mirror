Description:
 An out-of-bounds read/write access issue was found in the USB emulator of
 the QEMU. It occurs while processing USB packets from a guest, when
 'USBDevice->setup_len' exceeds the USBDevice->data_buf[4096], in
 do_token_{in,out} routines.  A guest user may use this flaw to crash the
 QEMU process resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary code with
 the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.
