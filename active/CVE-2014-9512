Description:
 rsync 3.1.1 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a
 symlink attack on a file in the synchronization path.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> rsync 3.1.1 introduced invalid filename filtering to prevent
 mdeslaur> malicious servers from sending files outside of the specified
 mdeslaur> directory: 
 mdeslaur> https://git.samba.org/?p=rsync.git;a=commit;h=4cad402ea8a91031f86c53961d78bb7f4f174790
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> CVE-2014-9512 is about malicious servers being able to bypass
 mdeslaur> that filtering by changing paths.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> This is a security hardening feature that was added in 3.1.1.
 mdeslaur> Either the whole feature needs to be backported to versions
 mdeslaur> earlier than 3.1.1, or this issue doesn't apply to them.
