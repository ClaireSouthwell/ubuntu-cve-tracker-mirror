Description:
 In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.28, 7.3.x below 7.3.15 and 7.4.x below
 7.4.3, when creating PHAR archive using PharData::buildFromIterator()
 function, the files are added with default permissions (0666, or all
 access) even if the original files on the filesystem were with more
 restrictive permissions. This may result in files having more lax
 permissions than intended when such archive is extracted.
