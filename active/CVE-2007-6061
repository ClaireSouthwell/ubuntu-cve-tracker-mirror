Description:
 Audacity 1.3.2 creates a temporary directory with a predictable name
 without checking for previous existence of that directory, which allows
 local users to cause a denial of service (recording deadlock) by creating
 the directory before Audacity is run.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to
 delete arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 fujitsu> The denial of service requires changing the ownership of the
          directory after audacity is already running.
