Description:
 OpenVPN, when using a 64-bit block cipher, makes it easier for remote
 attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a
 long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTP-over-OpenVPN
 session using Blowfish in CBC mode, aka a "Sweet32" attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> openvpn 2.3 and earlier use BF-CBC by default unless the cipher
 mdeslaur> is specified manually. 2.3.12 was modified to display a warning
 mdeslaur> if a 64-bit cipher is selected.
 mdeslaur> Since this is just a warning, downgrading priority to low
