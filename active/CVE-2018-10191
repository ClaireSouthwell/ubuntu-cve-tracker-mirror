 https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues/3995
Description:
 In versions of mruby up to and including 1.4.0, an integer overflow exists
 in src/vm.c::mrb_vm_exec() when handling OP_GETUPVAR in the presence of
 deep scope nesting, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker that can
 cause Ruby code to be run can use this to possibly execute arbitrary code.
