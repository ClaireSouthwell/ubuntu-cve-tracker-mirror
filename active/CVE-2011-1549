Description:
 The default configuration of logrotate on Gentoo Linux uses root privileges
 to process files in directories that permit non-root write access, which
 allows local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging
 logrotate's lack of support for untrusted directories, as demonstrated by
 directories under /var/log/ for packages.
