Description: 
 Florian Weimer reported that the hash function in the json-c library was
 weak, and that parsing smallish JSON strings showed quadratic timing
 behaviour.  This could cause an application linked to the json-c
 library, and that processes some specially-crafted JSON data, to use
 excessive amounts of CPU.
