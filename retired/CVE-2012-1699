Description:
 The ProcSetEventMask function in difs/events.c in the xfs font server for
 X.Org X11R6 through X11R6.6 and XFree86 before 3.3.3 calls the
 SendErrToClient function with a mask value instead of a pointer, which
 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
 crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from memory via a
 SetEventMask request that triggers an invalid pointer dereference.
