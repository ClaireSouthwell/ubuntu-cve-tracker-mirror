Description: 
 A security flaw was found in the way Sudo performed matching
 for user described by a password against the list of members,
 allowed to run particular sudo command, when the group option
 was specified on the command line. If a local, unprivileged
 user was authorized by sudoers file to run their sudo commands
 with permissions of a particular group (different to their own),
 it could lead to privilege escalation (execution of that sudo
 command with permissions of privileged user account (root)).
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> root escalation, but requires non-standard sudoers setup
 jdstrand> sudo 1.6 is not affected (does not have '-g' option)
