Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in
 ext/mbstring/libmbfl/filters/mbfilter_htmlent.c in the mbstring extension
 in PHP 4.3.0 through 5.2.6 allows context-dependent attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted string containing an HTML entity, which is not
 properly handled during Unicode conversion, related to the (1)
 mb_convert_encoding, (2) mb_check_encoding, (3) mb_convert_variables, and
 (4) mb_parse_str functions.
