Description:
 The (1) setfacl and (2) getfacl commands in XFS acl 2.2.47, when running in
 recursive (-R) mode, follow symbolic links even when the --physical (aka
 -P) or -L option is specified, which might allow local users to modify the
 ACL for arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack.
