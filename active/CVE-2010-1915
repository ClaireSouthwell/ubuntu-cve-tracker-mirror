Description:
 The preg_quote function in PHP 5.2 through 5.2.13 and 5.3 through 5.3.2
 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory
 contents) by causing a userspace interruption of an internal function,
 related to the call time pass by reference feature, modification of ZVALs
 whose values are not updated in the associated local variables, and access
 of previously-freed memory.
