Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u121, 7u111, 8u102; and Java
 SE Embedded 8u101 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via
 vectors related to Networking.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly handle HTTP proxy
 authentication. An attacker could use this to expose HTTPS server
 authentication credentials.
Notes:
 sbeattie> from the upstream release notes:
   In some environments, certain authentication schemes
   may be undesirable when proxying HTTPS. Accordingly,
   the Basic authentication scheme has been deactivated, by
   default, in the Oracle Java Runtime, by adding Basic to the
   jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes networking property. Now,
   proxies requiring Basic authentication when setting up a tunnel
   for HTTPS will no longer succeed by default. If required, this
   authentication scheme can be reactivated by removing Basic from
   the jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes networking property,
   or by setting a system property of the same name to "" ( empty )
   on the command line.
   .
   Additionally, the jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes and
   jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes networking properties,
   and system properties of the same name, can be used to disable
   other authentication schemes that may be active when setting up
   a tunnel for HTTPS, or proxying plain HTTP, respectively.
