Description: 
 The UNIX socket that is used for communication between the sudo
 utility and the sssd-sudo responder had its permissions set to world-readable
 and writable, which means that anyone who can send a message using the same
 raw protocol that sudo and SSSD use can read the sudo rules available for
 any user.  The sudo responder is not started by default by SSSD itself.
