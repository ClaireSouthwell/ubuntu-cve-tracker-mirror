Candidate: CVE-2006-3005
References: 
Description:
 The JPEG library in media-libs/jpeg before 6b-r7 on Gentoo Linux is built
 without the -maxmem feature, which could allow context-dependent attackers
 to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) via a crafted JPEG file
 that exceeds the intended memory limits.
