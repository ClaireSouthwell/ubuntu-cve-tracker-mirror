Description:
 The attempted fix to address CVE-2013-2154 introduced the possibility
 of a heap overflow, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution, in
 the processing of malformed XPointer expressions in the XML Signature
 Reference processing code. An attacker could use this to exploit
 an application performing signature verification if the application
 does not block the evaluation of such references prior to performing
 the verification step. The exploit would occur prior to the actual
 verification of the signature, so does not require authenticated content.
