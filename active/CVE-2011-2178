Description: 
 Regression introduced in commit d6623003 (v0.8.8) - using the
 wrong sizeof operand meant that security manager private data
 was overlaying the allowDiskFOrmatProbing member of struct
 _virSecurityManager.  This reopens disk probing, which was
 supposed to be prevented by the solution to CVE-2010-2238.
