Description:
 The process_stat function in (1) Memcached before 1.2.8 and (2) MemcacheDB
 1.2.0 discloses (a) the contents of /proc/self/maps in response to a stats
 maps command and (b) memory-allocation statistics in response to a stats
 malloc command, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information such as the locations of memory regions, and defeat ASLR
 protection, by sending a command to the daemon's TCP port.
