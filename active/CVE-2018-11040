Description:
 Spring Framework, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.7 and 4.3.x prior to 4.3.18
 and older unsupported versions, allows web applications to enable
 cross-domain requests via JSONP (JSON with Padding) through
 AbstractJsonpResponseBodyAdvice for REST controllers and
 MappingJackson2JsonView for browser requests. Both are not enabled by
 default in Spring Framework nor Spring Boot, however, when
 MappingJackson2JsonView is configured in an application, JSONP support is
 automatically ready to use through the "jsonp" and "callback" JSONP
 parameters, enabling cross-domain requests.
