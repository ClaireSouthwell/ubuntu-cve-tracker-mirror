Description:
 Perl before 5.30.3 on 32-bit platforms allows a heap-based buffer overflow
 because nested regular expression quantifiers have an integer overflow.

  An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if
  it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating
  regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the
  regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service
  attacks in this usage scenario.

  Additionally, the target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to
  allocate partial expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the
  overflow occurring. This requirement is unlikely to be met on 64bit
  systems.]
