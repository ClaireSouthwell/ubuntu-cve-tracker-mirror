Description:
 session.c in the session extension in PHP before 5.2.13, and 5.3.1, does
 not properly interpret ; (semicolon) characters in the argument to the
 session_save_path function, which allows context-dependent attackers to
 bypass open_basedir and safe_mode restrictions via an argument that
 contains multiple ; characters in conjunction with a .. (dot dot).
