Description: 
 An integer overflow issue was found in the QEMU Guest Agent in QEMU, while
 reading argument list passed to the 'guest-exec' qmp command. An attacker
 could exploit this by sending a crafted QMP command to the agent via a
 listening socket to trigger the overflow. It may crash the QEMU guest
 agent, resulting in DoS.
