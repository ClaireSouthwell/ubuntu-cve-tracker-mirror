Description:
 It is now disallowed for `.gitmodules` to have entries that set
 `submodule.<name>.update=!command`. This fixes the vulnerability
 in Git v2.20.0 and later where a recursive clone followed by a
 submodule update could execute code contained within the repository
 without the user explicitly having asked for that.
