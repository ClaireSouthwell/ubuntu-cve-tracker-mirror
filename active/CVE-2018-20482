Description:
 GNU Tar through 1.30, when --sparse is used, mishandles file shrinkage
 during read access, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
 (infinite read loop in sparse_dump_region in sparse.c) by modifying a file
 that is supposed to be archived by a different user's process (e.g., a
 system backup running as root).
