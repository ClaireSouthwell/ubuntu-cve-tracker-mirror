Description:
 In Hibernate Validator 5.2.x before 5.2.5 final, 5.3.x, and 5.4.x, it was
 found that when the security manager's reflective permissions, which allows
 it to access the private members of the class, are granted to Hibernate
 Validator, a potential privilege escalation can occur. By allowing the
 calling code to access those private members without the permission an
 attacker may be able to validate an invalid instance and access the private
 member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue().
