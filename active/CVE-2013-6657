Description:
 core/html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp in the XSS auditor in Blink, as used in
 Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.117, inserts the about:blank URL during
 certain blocking of FORM elements within HTTP requests, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and obtain sensitive information
 via unspecified vectors.
