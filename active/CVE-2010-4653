Description:
 Due to an integer overflow when parsing CharCodes for fonts and a
 failure to check the return value of a memory allocation, it is
 possible to trigger writes to a narrow range of offsets from a NULL
 pointer.  The chance of being able to exploit this for anything other
 than a crash is very remote: on x86 32-bit, there's no chance (since
 the write occurs between 0xffffffc4 and 0xfffffffc).  At least the
 write lands in valid userspace on x86-64, but in my testing this
 memory is never mapped.

Notes: 
 jdstrand> xpdf in koffice is 2.0
 jdstrand> poppler patch on 10.04 and 10.10 does not have GooLikely.h
  so will need to add inline to poppler/CharCodeToUnicode.cc
