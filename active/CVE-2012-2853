Description:
 The webRequest API in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and
 Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does not
 properly interact with the Chrome Web Store, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
 a crafted web site.
