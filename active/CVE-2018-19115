 https://github.com/acassen/keepalived/pull/961
Description:
 keepalived before 2.0.7 has a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP
 status codes resulting in DoS or possibly unspecified other impact, because
 extract_status_code in lib/html.c has no validation of the status code and
 instead writes an unlimited amount of data to the heap.
