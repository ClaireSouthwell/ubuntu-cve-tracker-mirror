Description:
 Live-migrated instances are briefly able to inspect traffic for other
 instances on the same hypervisor. This brief window could be extended
 indefinitely if the instance's port is set administratively down prior to
 live-migration and kept down after the migration is complete. This is
 possible due to the Open vSwitch integration bridge being connected to the
 instance during migration. When connected to the integration bridge, all
 traffic for instances using the same Open vSwitch instance would
 potentially be visible to the migrated guest, as the required Open vSwitch
 VLAN filters are only applied post-migration. Versions of openstack-neutron
 before 13.0.0.0b2, 12.0.3, 11.0.5 are vulnerable.
