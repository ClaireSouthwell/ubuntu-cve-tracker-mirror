Description:
 The httpClientDiscardBody function in client.c in Polipo 0.9.8, 0.9.12,
 1.0.4, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (crash) via a request with a large Content-Length value,
 which triggers an integer overflow, a signed-to-unsigned conversion error
 with a negative value, and a segmentation fault.
