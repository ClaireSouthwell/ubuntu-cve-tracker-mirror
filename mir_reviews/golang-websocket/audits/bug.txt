I reviewed golang-websocket version 0.0~git20150811.0.b6ab76f-1 as checked
into xenial. This should not be considered a full security audit.

- This package provides server-side websockets support
- Build-Depends: debhelper, dh-golang, golang-go
- Small use of cryptography in generating tokens
  - sha1(16 bytes random || "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11")
    I expect this use of sha-1 is fine
- Does not itself daemonize
- Does networking but under control of an application
- No maint scripts
- No init scripts
- No dbus services
- No setuid
- No binaries
- No sudo
- No udev
- Smallish but nice test suite run during the build
- No cronjobs
- Clean build logs
- No subprocesses spawned
- No manual memory management
- No file IO
- Logging looked fine
- No environment variables
- No privileged operations
- Only implements hashing; can be configured to not check hostname
  validity of TLS sessions, seems fair
- Network input looked well-checked
- No privileged portions of code
- No temporary files
- No WebKit
- No PolicyKit


The code looks clean and clear, with tasteful comments, nice tidy test
suite.

Security team ACK for promoting golang-websocket to main. Note the
comments that suggested only the -dev package is needed.

Thanks
