Description:
 Polipo 1.0.4, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (crash) via a request with a Cache-Control header that
 lacks a value for the max-age field, which triggers a segmentation fault in
 the httpParseHeaders function in http_parse.c, and possibly other
 unspecified vectors.
