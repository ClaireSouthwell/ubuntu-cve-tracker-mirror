Description:
 The ASN1_TYPE_cmp function in crypto/asn1/a_type.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a
 does not properly perform boolean-type comparisons, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid read operation and
 application crash) via a crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses
 the certificate-verification feature.
