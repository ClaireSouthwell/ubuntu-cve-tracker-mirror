Description:
 A vulnerability was found in sssd. If a user was configured with no home
 directory set, sssd would return '/' (the root directory) instead of ''
 (the empty string / no home directory). This could impact services that
 restrict the user's filesystem access to within their home directory
 through chroot() etc. All versions before 2.1 are vulnerable.
