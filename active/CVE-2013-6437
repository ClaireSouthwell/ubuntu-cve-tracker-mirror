Description:
 The libvirt driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2013.2.2 and icehouse
 before icehouse-2 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of
 service (disk consumption) by creating and deleting instances with unique
 os_type settings, which triggers the creation of a new ephemeral disk
 backing file.
