Description: 
 A vulnerability found in Puppet could allow an authenticated client to
 execute arbitrary code on a puppet master that is running in the default
 configuration, or an agent with `puppet kick` enabled. Specifically, a
 properly authenticated and connected puppet agent could be made to
 construct an HTTP PUT request for an authorized report that actually
 causes the execution of arbitrary code on the master. This only affects
 puppet 2.6.x (and so only PE 1.2 and below).
