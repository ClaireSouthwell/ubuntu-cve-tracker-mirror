Description:
 SQL-Ledger 2.4.4 through 2.6.17 authenticates users by verifying that the
 value of the sql-ledger-[username] cookie matches the value of the
 sessionid parameter, which allows remote attackers to gain access as any
 logged-in user by setting the cookie and the parameter to the same value.
