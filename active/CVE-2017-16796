Description:
 In SWFTools 0.9.2, the png_load function in lib/png.c does not check the
 return value of a realloc call, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (invalid write and application crash) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via vectors involving an IDAT tag in a crafted PNG
 file.
