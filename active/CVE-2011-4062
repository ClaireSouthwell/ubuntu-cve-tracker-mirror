Description:
 Buffer overflow in the "linux emulation" support in FreeBSD 7.3 and 7.4,
 8.1 and 8.2, and 9 before 9.0-RC1 allows local users to cause a denial of
 service (panic) and possibly execute arbitrary code by calling the bind
 system call with a long path for a UNIX-domain socket, which is not
 properly handled when the address is used by other unspecified system
 calls.
