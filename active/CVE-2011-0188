Description:
 The VpMemAlloc function in bigdecimal.c in the BigDecimal class in Ruby
 1.9.2-p136 and earlier, as used on Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.7 and other
 platforms, does not properly allocate memory, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
 service (application crash) via vectors involving creation of a large
 BigDecimal value within a 64-bit process, related to an "integer truncation
 issue."
