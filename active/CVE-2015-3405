Description:
 Creating MD5 keys will fail on big endian machines: A random byte
 is placed into the lowest memory address of an int, and the LSB is
 extracted from this integer. This is the same byte on little-endian
 machines, but on big endian machines the wrong end of the integer
 is extracted over and over again.  If this byte is rejected, the
 program is trapped in an infinite loop; if the byte is accepted
 as a random byte, the program terminates but the byte sequence is
 probably anything but random.
