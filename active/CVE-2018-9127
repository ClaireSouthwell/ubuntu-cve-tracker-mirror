Description:
 Botan 2.2.0 - 2.4.0 (fixed in 2.5.0) improperly handled wildcard
 certificates and could accept certain certificates as valid for hostnames
 when, under RFC 6125 rules, they should not match. This only affects
 certificates issued to the same domain as the host, so to impersonate a
 host one must already have a wildcard certificate matching other hosts in
 the same domain. For example, b*.example.com would match some hostnames
 that do not begin with a 'b' character.
