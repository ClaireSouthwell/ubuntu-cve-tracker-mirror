Description:
 A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the PJSIP channel
 driver's pub/sub framework. If an attempt is made to unsubscribe when
 not currently subscribed and the endpoint's “sub_min_expiry” is set
 to zero, Asterisk tries to create an expiration timer with zero seconds,
 which is not allowed, so an assertion raised.
