Description:
 Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that use pthread and
 fork after a call to nss_ldap, does not properly handle the LDAP
 connection, which might cause nss_ldap to return the wrong user data to the
 wrong process.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with
 the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be
 affected.
