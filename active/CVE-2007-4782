Candidate: CVE-2007-4782
References: 
Description: 
 PHP before 5.2.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) via (1) a long string in the pattern parameter to
 the glob function; or (2) a long string in the string parameter to the fnmatch
 function, accompanied by a pattern parameter value with undefined
 characteristics, as demonstrated by a "*[1]e" value. NOTE: this might not be a
 vulnerability in most web server environments that support multiple threads,
 unless these issues can be demonstrated for code execution.
