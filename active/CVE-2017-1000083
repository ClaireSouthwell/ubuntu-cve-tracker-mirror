Description:
 The comic book backend in evince 3.24.0 is vulnerable to a command
 injection bug that can be used to execute arbitrary commands when a cbt
 file is opened.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Felix Wilhelm discovered that Evince did not safely invoke tar when
 handling tar comic book (cbt) files. An attacker could use this to
 construct a malicious comic book format file that, when opened in
 Evince, executes arbitrary code.
Notes:
 sbeattie> upstream evince in git has switched to using libarchive
 sbeattie> The fix for this issue disables CBT support, as tar offers to
   many opportunities to invoke commands and CBT is a rarely used comic
   book format.
