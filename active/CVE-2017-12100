Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow exists in the 'multires_load_old_dm'
 functionality of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite v2.78c. A
 specially crafted .blend file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a
 buffer overflow which can allow for code execution under the context of the
 application. An attacker can convince a user to open a .blend file in order
 to trigger this vulnerability.
