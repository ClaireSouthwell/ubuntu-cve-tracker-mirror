Description:
 The VNC server implementation in QEMU, as used by Xen and possibly other
 environments, allows local users of a guest operating system to read
 arbitrary files on the host operating system via unspecified vectors
 related to QEMU monitor mode, as demonstrated by mapping files to a CDROM
 device.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
 information.
