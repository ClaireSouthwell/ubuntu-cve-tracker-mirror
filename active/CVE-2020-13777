Description:
 GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.14 uses incorrect cryptography for encrypting a
 session ticket (a loss of confidentiality in TLS 1.2, and an authentication
 bypass in TLS 1.3). The earliest affected version is 3.6.4 (2018-09-24)
 because of an error in a 2018-09-18 commit. Until the first key rotation,
 the TLS server always uses wrong data in place of an encryption key derived
 from an application.
