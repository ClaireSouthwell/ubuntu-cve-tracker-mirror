Candidate: CVE-2017-7481

Description:
 Ansible before versions 2.3.1.0 and 2.4.0.0 fails to properly mark
 lookup-plugin results as unsafe. If an attacker could control the results
 of lookup() calls, they could inject Unicode strings to be parsed by the
 jinja2 templating system, resulting in code execution. By default, the
 jinja2 templating language is now marked as 'unsafe' and is not evaluated.
