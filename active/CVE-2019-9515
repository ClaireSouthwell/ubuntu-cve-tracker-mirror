Description:
 Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially
 leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS
 frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with one
 acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS frame is almost
 equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this data is
 queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.
