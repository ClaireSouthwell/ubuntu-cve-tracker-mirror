Candidate: CVE-2006-3665
References: 
Description:
 SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and earlier, with register_globals enabled, allows
 remote attackers to hijack cookies in src/redirect.php via unknown vectors.
  NOTE: while "cookie theft" is frequently associated with XSS, the vendor
 disclosure is too vague to be certain of this.
