Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it
 installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had
 intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only
 affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that
 the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the
 attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE:
 it has been reported that this is intended functionality and the user is
 responsible for using --extra-index-url securely.
