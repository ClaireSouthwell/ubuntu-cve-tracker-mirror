Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in SQL-Ledger, and LedgerSMB before
 1.1.5, allows remote attackers to read and overwrite arbitrary files, and
 execute arbitrary code, via . (dot) characters adjacent to (1) users and
 (2) users/members strings, which are removed by blacklisting functions that
 filter these strings and collapse into .. (dot dot) sequences.
