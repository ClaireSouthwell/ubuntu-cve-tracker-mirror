Description:
 A flaw was found in how qemu, in snapshot mode (-snapshot command line
 argument), handled the creation and opening of the temporary file used to
 store the difference of the virtualized guest's read-only image and the
 current state.  In snapshot mode, bdrv_open() creates an empty temporary file
 without checking for any mkstemp() or close() failures; it also ignores the
 possibility of a buffer overrun given an exceptionally long $TMPDIR.  Because
 qemu re-opens that file after creation, it is possible to race qemu and insert
 a symbolic link with the same expected name as the temporary file, pointing to
 an attacker-chosen file.  This can be used to either overwrite the destination
 file with the privileges of the user running qemu (typically root), or to
 point to an attacker-readable file that could expose data from the guest to
 the attacker.
