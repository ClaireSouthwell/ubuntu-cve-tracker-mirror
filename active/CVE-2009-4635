Description:
 FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MOV container with improperly
 ordered tags that cause (1) mov.c and (2) utils.c to use inconsistent codec
 types and identifiers, which causes the mp3 decoder to process a pointer
 for a video structure, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
