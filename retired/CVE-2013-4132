Description:
 KDE-Workspace 4.10.5 and earlier does not properly handle the return value
 of the glibc 2.17 crypt and pw_encrypt functions, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash)
 via (1) an invalid salt or a (2) DES or (3) MD5 encrypted password, when
 FIPS-140 is enable, to KDM or an (4) invalid password to KCheckPass.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 seth-arnold> NULL return from crypt() if the salt isn't sane
 mdeslaur> This is only an issue on glibc 2.17+, so precise and quantal
 mdeslaur> aren't affected. Also, our kde-workspace packages are compiled
 mdeslaur> with pam support, so they shouldn't be vulnerable.
