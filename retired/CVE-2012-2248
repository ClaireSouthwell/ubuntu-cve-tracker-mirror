Description: 
 dhclient hooks are called with a PATH set to the build environment
 directory. In debian:
 PATH=/home/zero79/source/git/isc-dhcp/debian/tmp/usr/sbin
 A local user called zero79 can execute arbitrary scripts as root.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> In Ubuntu, the build directory is set to 
 mdeslaur> PATH=/build/buildd/isc-dhcp-4.2.4/debian/tmp/usr/sbin.
 mdeslaur> since it is a top-level directory, the attacker would need to
 mdeslaur> be root to exploit this. Also, USN-1571-1 sets an explicit
 mdeslaur> PATH in dhclient-script, so it's likely we're not vulnerable at
 mdeslaur> all.
