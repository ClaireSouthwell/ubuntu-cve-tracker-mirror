Description:
 Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before
 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does not request user
 confirmation before continuing a large series of downloads, which allows
 user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
 consumption) via a crafted web site.
