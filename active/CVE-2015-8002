Description:
 There is nothing preventing a badly coded or malicious client from
 sending a file in chunks of one byte. This could be exploited to flood
 a server with files and create file management overhead as well. All
 but the final block should have a minimum chunk size. There should also
 be a "final chunk" marker of some kind to allow only one final chunk
 and not several. This avoids a near-identical exploit where the "final"
 chunk is a single byte, but is kept below an ever-changing filesize.
