Description:
 libffi requests an executable stack allowing attackers to more easily
 trigger arbitrary code execution by overwriting the stack. Please note that
 libffi is used by a number of other libraries. It was previously stated
 that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears to be incorrect.
 libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was vulnerable, and
 upstream is believed to have fixed this issue in version 3.1.
