Description:
 The read_new_line function in wiretap/catapult_dct2000.c in the Catapult
 DCT2000 dissector in Wireshark 1.10.x before 1.10.9 does not properly strip
 '\n' and '\r' characters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (off-by-one buffer underflow and application crash) via a
 crafted packet.
