Description:
 A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF
 image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of
 functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format
 files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF
 document file, when malformed image-length and resolution values are
 used in the TIFF file. A remote attacker could provide a specially-
 crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would
 lead to tiff2pdf executable crash.
