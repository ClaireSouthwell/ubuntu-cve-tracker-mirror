PublicDate: 2007-10-01
Candidate: CVE-2007-5162
References: 
 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-596-1
Description:
 The connect method in lib/net/http.rb in the (1) Net::HTTP and (2)
 Net::HTTPS libraries in Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 does not verify that the
 commonName (CN) field in a server certificate matches the domain name in an
 HTTPS request, which makes it easier for remote attackers to intercept SSL
 transmissions via a man-in-the-middle attack or spoofed web site.
