 1.4.28 on Debian GNU/Linux creates a socket file with a predictable name in
 /tmp, which allows local users to hijack the PHP control socket and perform
 unauthorized actions such as forcing the use of a different version of PHP
 via a symlink attack or a race condition.

  restrictions in Ubuntu 11.10 and higher
