Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  vdrleaktest in Video Disk Recorder (VDR) 1.6.0 places a
 zero-length directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows local users
 to gain privileges via a Trojan horse shared library in the current working
 directory.  NOTE: a third party disputes this issue because the script
 erroneously uses a semicolon in a context where a colon was intended.
