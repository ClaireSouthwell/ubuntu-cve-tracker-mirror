Description:
 The ObjectBackedNativeHandler class in
 extensions/renderer/object_backed_native_handler.cc in the extensions
 subsystem in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.80 improperly implements
 handler functions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that leverage
 "type confusion."
