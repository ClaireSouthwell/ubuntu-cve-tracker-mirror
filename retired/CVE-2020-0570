Description:
 QLibrary in Qt versions 5.12.0 through 5.14.0, on certain x86 machines, would 
 search for certain libraries and plugins relative to current working directory 
 of the application, which allows an attacker that can place files in the file 
 system and influence the working directory of Qt-based applications to load 
 and execute malicious code. This issue was verified on Linux and probably 
 affects all Unix operating systems, other than macOS (Darwin). This issue does 
 not affect Windows.
