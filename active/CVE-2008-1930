Description:
 The cookie authentication method in WordPress 2.5 relies on a hash of a
 concatenated string containing USERNAME and EXPIRY_TIME, which allows
 remote attackers to forge cookies by registering a username that results in
 the same concatenated string, as demonstrated by registering usernames
 beginning with "admin" to obtain administrator privileges, aka a
 "cryptographic splicing" issue.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of
 an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-6013.
