Description:
 In WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3.0, the function
 wp_targeted_link_rel() can be used in a particular way to result in a
 stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This has been patched in
 WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to
 5.3 via a minor release. Automatic updates are enabled by default for minor
 releases and we strongly recommend that you keep them enabled.
