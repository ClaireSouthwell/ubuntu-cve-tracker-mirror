 memory content leak when using xmlTextWriterWriteAttribute with malformed
 utf-8
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per Debian, This was initially reported to be a bug in libxml2, but
  it later showed that PHP
 mdeslaur> can't reproduce on quantal+
 mdeslaur> The reproducer only displays garbage if the suhosin patch is
 mdeslaur> applied, which is why it doesn't appear to work on quantal+
 mdeslaur> Need to check if libxml2 still walks past the end of the string
 mdeslaur> if the suhosin patch isn't applied.
