Description:
 It was found that the Apache Qpid daemon (qpidd) treated AMQP connections
 with the federation_tag attribute set as a broker-to-broker connection,
 rather than a client-to-server connection. This resulted in the source
 user ID of messages not being checked. A client that can establish an
 AMQP connection with the broker could use this flaw to bypass intended
 authentication. For Condor users, if condor-aviary is installed, this
 flaw could be used to submit jobs that would run as any user (except
 root, as Condor does not run jobs as root).
