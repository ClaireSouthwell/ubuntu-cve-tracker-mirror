Description:
 An issue was discovered in Open-iSCSI through 2.0.875. A local attacker can
 cause the iscsiuio server to abort or potentially execute code by sending
 messages with incorrect lengths, which (due to lack of checking) can lead
 to buffer overflows, and result in aborts (with overflow checking enabled)
 or code execution. The process_iscsid_broadcast function in
 iscsiuio/src/unix/iscsid_ipc.c does not validate the payload length before
 a write operation.
