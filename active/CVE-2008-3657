Description:
 The dl module in Ruby 1.8.5 and earlier, 1.8.6 through 1.8.6-p286, 1.8.7
 through 1.8.7-p71, and 1.9 through r18423 does not check "taintness" of
 inputs, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass safe levels and
 execute dangerous functions by accessing a library using DL.dlopen.
