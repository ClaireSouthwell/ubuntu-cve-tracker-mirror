Description: 
 An integer overflow flaw leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was
 discovered in the way the texttopdf utility of cups-filter processed
 print jobs with a specially crafted line size. An attacker being able
 to submit print jobs could exploit this flaw to crash texttopdf or,
 possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the 'lp' user.
