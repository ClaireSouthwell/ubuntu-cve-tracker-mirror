Description: 
 ISC dhclient has a stack overflow vulnerability which makes it theoretically
 possible for a rogue DHCP server to execute arbitrary commands as root on the
 affected system through stack return subversion.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> requires connecting to a malicious dhcp v4 server. Assigning
  high priority due to widespread use and frequency of roaming users connecting
  to untrusted dhcp servers
 jdstrand> CERT VU#410676
 jdstrand> this is only a DoS on Intrepid and later due to FORTIFY_SOURCE and
  can be considered 'low'. Jaunty also has an AppArmor profile that fully
  mitigates arbitrary code execution.
