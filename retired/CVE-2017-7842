Description:
 If a document's Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes
 two network requests are made for "<link>" elements instead of one. One of
 these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy
 to not include a referrer on requests. This vulnerability affects Firefox <
 57.
