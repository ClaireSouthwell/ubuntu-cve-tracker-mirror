Description:
 MySQL before 5.0.67 allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks
 by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY
 or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are originally associated with
 pathnames without symlinks, and that can point to tables created at a
 future time at which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a
 subdirectory of the MySQL home data directory. NOTE: this vulnerability
 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4097.
