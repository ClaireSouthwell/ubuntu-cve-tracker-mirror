Description:
 A memory allocation flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was
 found in spice's smartcard interaction, which runs under the QEMU-KVM
 context on the host. A user connecting to a guest VM via spice could
 possibly exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU-KVM process, or, possibly,
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the host QEMU-KVM process.
