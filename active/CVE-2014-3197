Description:
 The NavigationScheduler::schedulePageBlock function in
 core/loader/NavigationScheduler.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome
 before 38.0.2125.101, does not properly provide substitute data for pages
 blocked by the XSS auditor, which allows remote attackers to obtain
 sensitive information via a crafted web site.
