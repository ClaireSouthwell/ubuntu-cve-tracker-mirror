CoordinatedReleaseDate: 2008-03-18 1400 Eastern
Description: 
 In versions before 1.3, a similar bug can be triggered
 in similar circumstances, but is further limited to certain platforms.
 Solaris 10 and Mac OS X 10.4 appear to be unaffected, while GNU libc
 systems (e.g., many GNU/Linux distributions) are.  It appears that in
 at least some cases kadmind will simply exit after getting a "bad file
 descriptor" error, but this cannot be guaranteed.
