 http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.2.7
Description:
 PHP 5 before 5.2.7 does not enforce the error_log safe_mode restrictions
 when safe_mode is enabled through a php_admin_flag setting in httpd.conf,
 which allows context-dependent attackers to write to arbitrary files by
 placing a "php_value error_log" entry in a .htaccess file.
