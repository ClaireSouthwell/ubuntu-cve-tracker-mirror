Description:
 Evolution 2.22.3.1 checks S/MIME signatures against a copy of the e-mail
 text within a signed-data blob, not the copy of the e-mail text displayed
 to the user, which allows remote attackers to spoof a signature by
 modifying the latter copy, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-5077.
