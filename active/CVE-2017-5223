Description:
 An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer's msgHTML
 method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an
 email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image
 URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base
 directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLs
 get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form
 a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an
 unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.
