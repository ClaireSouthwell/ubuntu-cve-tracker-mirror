Description: 
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 chrisccoulson> Note that although the underlying bug affects upstream and
  all versions of ntfs-3g, it only has security implications when installed
  with setuid-root. This means it only affects Ubuntu releases since xenial,
  as prior releases don't install ntfs-3g with the setuid bit set.
