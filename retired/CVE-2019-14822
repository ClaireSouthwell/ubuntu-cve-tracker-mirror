Description:
 [ibus uses a GDBusServer with
  G_DBUS_SERVER_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATION_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS, and doesn't set a
  GDBusAuthObserver, which allows anyone who can connect to its AF_UNIX
  socket to authenticate and be authorized to send method calls.]
Ubuntu-Description:
 Simon McVittie discovered that ibus did not enforce appropriate access
 controls on its private D-Bus socket. A local unprivileged user who
 discovers the ibus socket address of another user could exploit this to
 capture the key strokes of the other user.
Notes:
 amurray> The ibus D-Bus socket address contains a long random guid making
  discovery of this address by another user unlikely.
Mitigation:
