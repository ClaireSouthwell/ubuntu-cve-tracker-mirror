Description:
 Buffer overflow in the RPC library (lib/rpc/rpc_dtablesize.c) used by
 libgssrpc and kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.2.2, and probably other
 versions before 1.3, when running on systems whose unistd.h library does
 not define the FD_SETSIZE macro, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by triggering a
 large number of open file descriptors.
