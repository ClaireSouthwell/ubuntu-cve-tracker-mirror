Description:
 It was discovered that Condor exposed private information in the data in
 the ClassAds format served by condor_startd. An unauthenticated user able
 to connect to condor_startd's port could request a ClassAd for a running
 job, provided they could guess or brute-force the PID of the job. This
 could expose the ClaimId which, if obtained, could be used to control the
 job as well as start new jobs on the system.
