Description:
 Drupal 7 contains two new features: the ability to attach File upload fields
 to any entity type in the system and the ability to point individual File
 upload fields to the private file directory.

 If a Drupal site is using these features on comments, and the parent node is
 denied access (either by a node access module or by being unpublished), the
 file attached to the comment can still be downloaded by non-privileged users if
 they know or guess its direct URL.

 This issue affects Drupal 7.x only.
