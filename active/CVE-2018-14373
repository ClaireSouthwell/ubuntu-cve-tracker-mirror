Description:
 An issue was discovered in LibTIFF 4.0.9. In TIFFFindField in
 tif_dirinfo.c, the structure tif is being dereferenced without first
 checking that the structure is not empty and has the requested fields
 (tif_foundfield). In the call sequences following from the affected library
 functions (TIFFVGetField, TIFFVGetFieldDefaulted, TIFFVStripSize,
 TIFFScanlineSize, TIFFTileSize, TIFFGetFieldDefaulted, and TIFFGetField),
 this sanitization of the tif structure is never being done and, hence,
 using them with an invalid or empty tif structure will trigger a buffer
 overflow, leading to a crash.
