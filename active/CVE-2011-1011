Description:
 The seunshare_mount function in sandbox/seunshare.c in seunshare in certain
 Red Hat packages of policycoreutils 2.0.83 and earlier in Red Hat
 Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 and earlier, and Fedora 14 and earlier, mounts a
 new directory on top of /tmp without assigning root ownership and the
 sticky bit to this new directory, which allows local users to replace or
 delete arbitrary /tmp files, and consequently cause a denial of service or
 possibly gain privileges, by running a setuid application that relies on
 /tmp, as demonstrated by the ksu application.
