 https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964
Description:
 supervisord can be configured to run an HTTP server on a TCP socket and/or a
 Unix domain socket. The HTTP server is how supervisorctl communicates with
 supervisord. If an HTTP server has been enabled, it will always serve both
 HTML pages and an XML-RPC interface. A vulnerability has been found where an
 authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to supervisord that
 will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as
 the same user as supervisord. Depending on how supervisord has been configured,
 this may be root.
 This vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated client or if
 supervisord has been configured to run an HTTP server without authentication.
