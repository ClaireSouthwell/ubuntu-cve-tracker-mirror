Description: 
 A flaw in the OpenSSL handling of CBC ciphersuites in TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 on
 AES-NI supporting platforms can be exploited in a DoS attack. Anyone using an
 AES-NI platform for TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1 on OpenSSL 1.0.1c is affected.
 Platforms which do not support AES-NI or versions of OpenSSL which do not
 implement TLS 1.2 or 1.1 (for example OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.0) are not
 affected.
