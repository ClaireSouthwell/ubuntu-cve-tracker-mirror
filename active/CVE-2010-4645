Description:
 strtod.c, as used in the zend_strtod function in PHP 5.2 before 5.2.17 and
 5.3 before 5.3.5, and other products, allows context-dependent attackers to
 cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a certain floating-point
 value in scientific notation, which is not properly handled in x87 FPU
 registers.
