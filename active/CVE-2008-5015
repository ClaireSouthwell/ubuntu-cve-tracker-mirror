Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.4 assigns chrome privileges to a file: URI
 when it is accessed in the same tab from a chrome or privileged about:
 page, which makes it easier for user-assisted attackers to execute
 arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges via malicious code in a file
 that has already been saved on the local system.
