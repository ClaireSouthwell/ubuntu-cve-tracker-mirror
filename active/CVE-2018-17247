Description:
 Elasticsearch Security versions 6.5.0 and 6.5.1 contain an XXE flaw in
 Machine Learning's find_file_structure API. If a policy allowing external
 network access has been added to Elasticsearch's Java Security Manager then
 an attacker could send a specially crafted request capable of leaking
 content of local files on the Elasticsearch node. This could allow a user
 to access information that they should not have access to.
