Description:
 The originates_from_local_legacy_unicast_socket function in
 avahi-core/server.c in avahi-daemon 0.6.23 does not account for the network
 byte order of a port number when processing incoming multicast packets,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (network
 bandwidth and CPU consumption) via a crafted legacy unicast mDNS query
 packet that triggers a multicast packet storm.
