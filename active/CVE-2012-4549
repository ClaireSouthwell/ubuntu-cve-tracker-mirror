Description: 
 When there are no allowed roles for an EJB method invocation, the invocation
 should be denied for all users. It was found that the processInvocation()
 method in org.jboss.as.ejb3.security.AuthorizationInterceptor incorrectly
 authorizes all method invocations to proceed when the list of allowed roles is
 empty.
