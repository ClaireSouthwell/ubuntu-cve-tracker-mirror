Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in voc_read_header in libsndfile 1.0.15 through
 1.0.19, as used in Winamp 5.552 and possibly other media programs, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a VOC file with an invalid header
 value.
