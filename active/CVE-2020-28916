Description:
 [An infinite loop issue was found in the e1000e device emulator in
 QEMU. The issue could occur while receiving packets via
 e1000e_write_packet_to_guest() routine, if the receive(RX) descriptor has
 NULL buffer address. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to induce a
 DoS scenario on the host.]
