Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 41.0.2272.76, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging incorrect ordering of
 operations in the Web SQL Database thread relative to Blink's main thread,
 related to the shutdown function in web/WebKit.cpp.
