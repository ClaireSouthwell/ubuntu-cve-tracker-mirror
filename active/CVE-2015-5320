Description:
 JNLP slave connections did not verify that the correct secret was supplied,
 which allowed malicious users to connect their own machines as slaves to
 Jenkins knowing only the name of the slave. This enables attackers to take
 over Jenkins (unless the slave-to-master security subsystem is enabled) or
 gain access to private data like keys and source code.
