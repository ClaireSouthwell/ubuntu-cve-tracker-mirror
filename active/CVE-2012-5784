Description:
 Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier, as used in PayPal Payments Pro, PayPal Mass
 Pay, PayPal Transactional Information SOAP, the Java Message Service
 implementation in Apache ActiveMQ, and other products, does not verify that
 the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN)
 or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid
 certificate.
