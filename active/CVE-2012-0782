Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
 wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in WordPress 3.3.1
 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
 via the (1) dbhost, (2) dbname, or (3) uname parameter. NOTE: the vendor
 disputes the significance of this issue; also, it is unclear whether this
 specific XSS scenario has security relevance.
