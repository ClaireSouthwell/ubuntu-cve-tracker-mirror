Description:
 Bug 54178 described a scenario where elements of a previous request may
 be exposed to a current request. This was very difficult to exploit
 deliberately but fairly likely to happen unexpectedly if an application
 used AsyncListeners that threw RuntimeExceptions. The issue was fixed by
 catching the RuntimeExceptions.
