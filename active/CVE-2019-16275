Description:
 hostapd (and wpa_supplicant when controlling AP mode) did not perform
 sufficient source address validation for some received Management frames
 and this could result in ending up sending a frame that caused associated
 stations to incorrectly believe they were disconnected from the network
 even if management frame protection (also known as PMF) was negotiated for
 the association. This could be considered to be a denial of service
 vulnerability since PMF is supposed to protect from this type of issues. It
 should be noted that if PMF is not enabled, there would be no protocol
 level protection against this type of denial service attacks.

 An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially
 constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to
 cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection
 to the network.
