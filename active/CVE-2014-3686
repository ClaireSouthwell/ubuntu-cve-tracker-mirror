Description:
 A vulnerability was found in the mechanism wpa_cli and hostapd_cli use
 for executing action scripts. An unsanitized string received from a
 remote device can be passed to a system() call resulting in arbitrary
 command execution under the privileges of the wpa_cli/hostapd_cli
 process (which may be root or at least network admin in common use
 cases).
