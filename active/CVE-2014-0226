Description:
 A race condition was found in mod_status. An attacker able to access a
 public server status page on a server using a threaded MPM could send a
 carefully crafted request which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. Note
 that it is not a default or recommended configuration to have a public
 accessible server status page.
