Description:
 The two interfaces virDomainSnapshotGetXMLDesc and
 virDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc would accept the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE flag in
 situations where virDomainGetXMLDesc did not, when fine-grained access control
 lists (ACL) are in use. As a result, a client can use a snapshot or save image
 to bypass restrictions and gain access to the secured information.
