Description:
 The TZ environment variable was passed through to children unchecked. Most
 libc tzset() implementations support passing an absolute pathname in the time
 zone to point to an arbitrary, user-controlled file. This may be used to
 exploit bugs in the C library's TZ parser or open files the user would not
 otherwise have access to. Arbitrary file access via TZ could also be used in a
 denial of service attack by reading from a file or fifo that will block.
