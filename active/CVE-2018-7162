Description:
 All versions of Node.js 9.x and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is
 HIGH. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node
 process which provides an http server supporting TLS server to crash. This
 can be accomplished by sending duplicate/unexpected messages during the
 handshake. This vulnerability has been addressed by updating the TLS
 implementation.
