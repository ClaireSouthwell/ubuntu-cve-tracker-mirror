Description:
 An issue was discovered in Apport through 2.20.x. In apport/report.py,
 Apport sets the ExecutablePath field and it then uses the path to run
 package specific hooks without protecting against path traversal. This
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .crash
 file.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 tyhicks> Apport registers itself as the default handler for .crash files so an
  attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious .crash file and execute
  arbitrary code as the user.
 tyhicks> A potential method of hardening apport against these types of attacks
  is to unregister it as the handler for .crash files.
