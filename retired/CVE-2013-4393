Description:
 A possibility for denial of loggin service was found in the way journald
 functionality of systemd, a system and service manager, processed native
 messages when file was chosen as their origin. A local attacker could use
 this flaw to provide a specially-crafted file descriptor, leading the
 journald file read process to block, resulting in portion of subsequent
 native messages intended to be logged to be ignored.
