- repair() allocates char parm[5], uses an unchecked sprintf() to write
  into it with %d -- this assumes that all callers provide 8-bit
  integers, but there's a lot to audit to determine this. parm[32]
  would be completely safe at near zero cost.
- pid file handling feels overly complicated; it feels like the goals of
  the pid file handling are muddled.
- write_heartbeat() feels overly complicated compared to standard
  append-only logs and log rotation
- try_mount_one() uses:
  setuid(getuid());
  setgid(getgid());
  - errors aren't checked
  - if this were lowering privileges, the gid could not be lowered
  - if this were raising privileges, it probably needed to use getresuid()
    instead.
  - Why are these here?
