Description:
 Calamares through 3.2.4 copies a LUKS encryption keyfile from
 /crypto_keyfile.bin (mode 0600 owned by root) to /boot within a globally
 readable initramfs image with insecure permissions, which allows this
 originally protected file to be read by any user, thereby disclosing
 decryption keys for LUKS containers created with Full Disk Encryption.
