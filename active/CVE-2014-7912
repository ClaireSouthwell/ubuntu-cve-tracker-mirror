Description:
 The get_option function in dhcp.c in dhcpcd before 6.2.0, as used in dhcpcd
 5.x in Android before 5.1 and other products, does not validate the
 relationship between length fields and the amount of data, which allows
 remote DHCP servers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
 (memory corruption) via a large length value of an option in a DHCPACK
 message.
