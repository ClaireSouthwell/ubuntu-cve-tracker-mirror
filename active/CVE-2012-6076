Description:
 inkscape reads .eps files from /tmp instead of the current directory
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> "low" priority due to symlink and hardlink restrictions in
 sarnold> Ubuntu's Linux kernels; without those protections, "medium"
 sarnold> would be more appropriate.
 sarnold> Multiple patches are proposed in the bugreport; NewAndUndoOld
 sarnold> appears to be preferred from comments #11 and #12
 mdeslaur> 0.48.4 has fix, albeit the older fix.
 mdeslaur> inkscape in lucid doesn't do the chdir into /tmp, so
 mdeslaur> not-affected
