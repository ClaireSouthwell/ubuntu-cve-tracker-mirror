Description:
 Squid 3.2.x before 3.2.14, 3.3.x before 3.3.14, 3.4.x before 3.4.13, and
 3.5.x before 3.5.4, when configured with client-first SSL-bump, does not
 properly validate the domain or hostname fields of X.509 certificates,
 which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid
 certificate.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> only an issue if squid3 is built with --enable-ssl, which isn't
 mdeslaur> the case on debian/ubuntu for licensing reasons.
 mdeslaur> However, we should probably fix this anyway as rebuilding
 mdeslaur> the Ubuntu package locally to enable ssl is a common scenario.
