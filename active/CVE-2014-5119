Description:
 __gconv_translit_find() incorrect memcpy().
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per researcher (Chris Evans), a path with an even number of
  characters to the gconv/ directory makes his exploit harmless. This happens
  to be true on Ubuntu with multiarch on 12.04 LTS and higher on amd64 and
  i386. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and armhf on all supported releases has an odd path
  length. There are likely other ways to exploit on Ubuntu.
