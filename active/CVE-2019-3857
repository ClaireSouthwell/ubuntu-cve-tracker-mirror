Description:
 An integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was
 discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
 packets with an exit signal are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a
 SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user
 connects to the server.
