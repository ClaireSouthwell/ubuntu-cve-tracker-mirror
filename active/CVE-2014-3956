 http://www.sendmail.com/sm/open_source/download/8.14.9/
Description:
 The sm_close_on_exec function in conf.c in sendmail before 8.14.9 has
 arguments in the wrong order, and consequently skips setting expected
 FD_CLOEXEC flags, which allows local users to access unintended
 high-numbered file descriptors via a custom mail-delivery program.
