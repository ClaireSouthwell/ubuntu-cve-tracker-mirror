Description:
 grub2 contains a use-after-free vulnerability which can be triggered by
 redefining a function whilst the same function is already executing.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Chris Coulson discovered that the GRUB2 function handling code did not
 properly handle a function being redefined, leading to a use-after-free
 vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code
 and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
Notes:
 amurray| grub2-signed is not supported in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (precise/esm)
  and so marking the priority for grub2 in this release as low
 sbeattie| 809f3a268 script: Avoid a use-after-free when
