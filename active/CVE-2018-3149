Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle
 Java SE (subcomponent: JNDI). Supported versions that are affected are Java
 SE: 6u201, 7u191, 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181; JRockit: R28.3.19.
 Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
 network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE
 Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a
 person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE,
 Java SE Embedded, JRockit, attacks may significantly impact additional
 products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover
 of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to
 Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
 applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run
 untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
 Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by
 using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which
 supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.3 (Confidentiality,
