Description:
 RT is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via attachment
 filenames. The vector is difficult to exploit due to parsing
 requirements. Additionally, RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to XSS
 via maliciously-crafted "URLs" in ticket content when RT's "MakeClicky"
 feature is configured. Although not believed to be exploitable in the
 stock configuration, a patch is also included for RTIR 2.6.x to add
 bulletproofing.
