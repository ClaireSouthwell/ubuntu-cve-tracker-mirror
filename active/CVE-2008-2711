Description:
 fetchmail 6.3.8 and earlier, when running in -v -v (aka verbose) mode,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash and persistent
 mail failure) via a malformed mail message with long headers, which
 triggers an erroneous dereference when using vsnprintf to format log
 messages.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per Debian, http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/06/13/1, -vv is only used for debugging purposes so this does not prevent a victim from getting mails. -vv is not used in non-interactive use.
