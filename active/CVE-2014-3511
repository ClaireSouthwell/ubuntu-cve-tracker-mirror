Description: 
 OpenSSL TLS protocol downgrade attack. A flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS
 server code causes the server to negotiate TLS 1.0 instead of higher
 protocol versions when the ClientHello message is badly fragmented. This
 allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to force a downgrade to TLS 1.0 even
 if both the server and the client support a higher protocol version, by
 modifying the client's TLS records.
