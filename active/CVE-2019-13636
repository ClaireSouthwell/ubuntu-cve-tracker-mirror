Description:
 GNU Patch contains a directory traversal flaw, where if a patch fails to
 apply the resulting .rej file, containing the rejected patch contents, can
 be written outside of the heirarchy of the current working directory when
 used in combination with a symbolic link patch fragment to make
 modifications to arbitrary files outside of the working directory.
