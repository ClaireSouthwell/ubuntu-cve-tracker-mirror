Description: 
 There is no quota for Fixed IPs. Previously the instance quota acted
 as a proxy for a Fixed IP quota, but if your configuration allows an
 instance to consume more than one Fixed IP via an extension such as
 multinic then this is no longer true. Running out of Fixed IPs would
 result in not being able to spawn new instances.
