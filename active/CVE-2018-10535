Description:
 The ignore_section_sym function in elf.c in the Binary File Descriptor
 (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, does not
 validate the output_section pointer in the case of a symtab entry with a
 "SECTION" type that has a "0" value, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a
 crafted file, as demonstrated by objcopy.
