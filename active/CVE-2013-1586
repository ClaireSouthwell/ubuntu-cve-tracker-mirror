Description:
 The fragment_set_tot_len function in epan/reassemble.c in Wireshark 1.6.x
 before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 does not properly determine the length
 of a reassembled packet for the DTLS dissector, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a malformed
 packet.
