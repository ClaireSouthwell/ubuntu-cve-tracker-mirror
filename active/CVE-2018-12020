Description:
 filename sanitization problem in GnuPG
 The OpenPGP protocol allows to include the file name of the original
 input file into a signed or encrypted message. During decryption and
 verification the GPG tool can display a notice with that file name.  The
 displayed file name is not sanitized and as such may include line feeds
 or other control characters. This can be used inject terminal control
 sequences into the out and, worse, to fake the so-called status
 messages. These status messages are parsed by programs to get
 information from gpg about the validity of a signature and an other
 parameters. Status messages are created with the option "--status-fd N"
 where N is a file descriptor. Now if N is 2 the status messages and the
 regular diagnostic messages share the stderr output channel. By using a
 made up file name in the message it is possible to fake status messages.
 Using this technique it is for example possible to fake the verification
 status of a signed mail.
