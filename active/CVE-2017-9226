Description:
 An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in
 Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds
 write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression
 compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled correctly in
 fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expression
 containing an octal number in the form of '\700' would produce an invalid
 code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in an
 out-of-bounds write memory corruption.
