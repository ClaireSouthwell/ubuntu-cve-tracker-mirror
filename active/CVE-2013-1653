Description: 
 A vulnerability has been found in Puppet which could allow authenticated
 clients to execute arbitrary code on agents that have been configured to
 accept kick connections. This vulnerability is not present in the default
 configuration of puppet agents, but if they have been configured to listen
 for incoming connections (`listen=true`), and the agentâ€™s auth.conf has
 been configured to allow access to the `run` REST endpoint, then a client
 could construct an HTTP request which could execute arbitrary code. The
 severity of this issue is exacerbated by the fact that puppet agents
 typically run as root.
