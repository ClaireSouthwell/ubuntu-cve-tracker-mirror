Description: 
 These calls assume that pointers are properly initialized by the
 XGetWindowProperty() function and don't check for failure of the
 function to return a valid window property, which can lead to use of
 uninitialized pointers for reading, writing, or passing to functions
 such as free(). XGetWindowProperty() in libX11 1.5.99.901 (1.6RC1)
 and earlier did not ensure returned pointers were initialized to NULL
 when returning a failure (this is fixed in libX11 1.5.99.902 and later).
