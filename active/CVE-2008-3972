Description:
 pkcs15-tool in OpenSC before 0.11.6 does not apply security updates to a
 smart card unless the card's label matches the "OpenSC" string, which might
 allow physically proximate attackers to exploit vulnerabilities that the
 card owner expected were patched, as demonstrated by exploitation of
 CVE-2008-2235.
