 http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html#2.2.15
Description:
 The ap_read_request function in server/protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server
 2.2.x before 2.2.15, when a multithreaded MPM is used, does not properly
 handle headers in subrequests in certain circumstances involving a parent
 request that has a body, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
 sensitive information via a crafted request that triggers access to memory
 locations associated with an earlier request.
