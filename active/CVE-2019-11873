Description:
 wolfSSL 4.0.0 has a Buffer Overflow in DoPreSharedKeys in tls13.c when a
 current identity size is greater than a client identity size. An attacker
 sends a crafted hello client packet over the network to a TLSv1.3 wolfSSL
 server. The length fields of the packet: record length, client hello
 length, total extensions length, PSK extension length, total identity
 length, and identity length contain their maximum value which is 2^16. The
 identity data field of the PSK extension of the packet contains the attack
 data, to be stored in the undefined memory (RAM) of the server. The size of
 the data is about 65 kB. Possibly the attacker can perform a remote code
 execution attack.
