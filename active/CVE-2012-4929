Description:
 The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, as used in Mozilla Firefox, Google
 Chrome, and other products, can encrypt compressed data without properly
 obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers by observing
 length differences during a series of guesses in which a string in an HTTP
 request potentially matches an unknown string in an HTTP header, aka a
 "CRIME" attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Fedora/RedHat has a patch to check for OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB that
  can be used to mitigate this flaw. See RedHat bug #857051
 jdstrand> No patch for upstream OpenSSL. This may be considered a flaw in the
  applications using OpenSSL and not OpenSSL itself.
