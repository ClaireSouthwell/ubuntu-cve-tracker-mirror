Description: 
 The functions quick_outI1_continue() and quick_outI1() copied
 pointers to state structs into the struct qke_continuation. When
 the original state struct was deleted, the stored pointer in
 qke_continuation was still pointing to these memory locations,
 causing the invalid memory access. The IKE daemon would crash
 and restart.
