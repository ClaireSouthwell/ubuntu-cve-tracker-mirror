Description:
 An issue was discovered in PHP 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and
 7.3.x before 7.3.2. dns_get_record misparses a DNS response, which can
 allow a hostile DNS server to cause PHP to misuse memcpy, leading to read
 operations going past the buffer allocated for DNS data. This affects
 php_parserr in ext/standard/dns.c for DNS_CAA and DNS_ANY queries.
