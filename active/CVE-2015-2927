Description:
 The SIGQUIT routine fails to close the app leaving the IP sockets open and in
 some cases DDOS the remote site if a user "ctrl-]+q" out of a telnet session.
 Also the app fails to close and more can be spawned by a crafty malicious user
 thus bringing the system to a point of no memory available.
