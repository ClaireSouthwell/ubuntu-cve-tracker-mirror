Description:
 The Autofill implementation in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.63 mishandles
 the interaction between field updates and JavaScript code that triggers a
 frame deletion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 web site, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-1701.
