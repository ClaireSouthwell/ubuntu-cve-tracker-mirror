Description: 
 Setting or deleting a large number of properties on a node (file or
 directory) will result in a large amount of memory use. Due to the memory
 pooling behavior of Apache httpd and Subversion the completion of the
 request will not result in the immediate release of memory used. Repeated
 commits with the same properties will result in each httpd process
 plateauing out at some amount of memory. This could result in a Denial
 of Service if the system is exhausted of all available memory.
