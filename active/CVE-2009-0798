Description: 
  The daemon in acpid before 1.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (CPU consumption and connectivity loss) by opening a large
 number of UNIX sockets without closing them, which triggers an infinite
 loop.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> The issue is that it seems that when the attacking processes
  exhausts the sockets in the acpid process, the acpid process goes into
  an infinite loop, consuming significant amount of CPU. I haven't proven
  it's "infinite" but running on a reasonable fast machine, I let it run
  for 15 minutes.
