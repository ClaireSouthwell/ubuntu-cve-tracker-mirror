 https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e37ef41289b77e0f0bb9a6aedb0360664c55bdd5 (2.7.x)
Description:
 Python 2.7.x through 2.7.16 and 3.x through 3.7.2 is affected by: Improper
 Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC
 normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure (credentials, cookies,
 etc. that are cached against a given hostname). The components are:
 urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A
 specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or
 authentication data and send that information to a different host than when
 parsed correctly.
