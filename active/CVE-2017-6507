Description: 
 Incorrect handling of unknown AppArmor profiles in AppArmor init scripts,
 upstart jobs, and/or systemd unit files allows an attacker to possibly have
 increased attack surfaces of processes that were intended to be confined by
 AppArmor. This is due to the common logic to handle 'restart' operations
 removing AppArmor profiles that aren't found in the typical filesystem
 locations, such as /etc/apparmor.d/. Projects that manage their own AppArmor
 profiles in atypical directories, such as what's done by LXD and Docker, are
 impacted by this flaw in the AppArmor init script logic.
 .
 The Debian/Ubuntu packaging for the apparmor package is also affected by this
 flaw as it attempts to restart AppArmor when configuring a new AppArmor
 package.
