Description:
 The OGNL extensive expression evaluation capability in XWork in Struts
 2.0.0 through 2.1.8.1, as used in Atlassian Fisheye, Crucible, and possibly
 other products, uses a permissive whitelist, which allows remote attackers
 to modify server-side context objects and bypass the "#" protection
 mechanism in ParameterInterceptors via the (1) #context, (2)
 #_memberAccess, (3) #root, (4) #this, (5) #_typeResolver, (6)
 #_classResolver, (7) #_traceEvaluations, (8) #_lastEvaluation, (9)
 #_keepLastEvaluation, and possibly other OGNL context variables, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2008-6504.
