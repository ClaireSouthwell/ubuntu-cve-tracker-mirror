Description:
 The DoResolveRelativeHost function in url/url_canon_relative.cc in Google
 Chrome before 30.0.1599.66 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (out-of-bounds read) via a relative URL containing a hostname, as
 demonstrated by a protocol-relative URL beginning with a //www.google.com/
 substring.
