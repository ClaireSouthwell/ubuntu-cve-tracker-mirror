Description: 
 Apache: mod_remoteip stack buffer overflow and NULL pointer
 dereference. When mod_remoteip was configured to use a trusted
 intermediary proxy server using the "PROXY" protocol, a specially
 crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer overflow or NULL
 pointer deference.  This vulnerability could only be triggered by
 a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients.
 .
 PROXY protocol support was added to mod_remoteip in release 2.4.33.
