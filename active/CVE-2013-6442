Description:
 The owner_set function in smbcacls.c in smbcacls in Samba 4.0.x before
 4.0.16 and 4.1.x before 4.1.6 removes an ACL during use of a --chown or
 --chgrp option, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
 restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging an unintended
 administrative change.
