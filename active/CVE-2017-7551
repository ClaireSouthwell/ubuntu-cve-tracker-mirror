Description:
 Password brute-force possible for locked account due to different return
 codes. The directory server password lockout policy prevents binds from
 operating once a threshold of failed passwords has been met. During this
 lockout, if you bind with a successful password, a different error code is
 returned. This means that an attacker has no ratelimit or penalty during an
 account lock, and can continue to attempt passwords via bruteforce.
