Description:
 By not removing several HTML5 JavaScript events, the
 API method t3lib_div::RemoveXSS() fails to filter specially crafted
 HTML injections, thus is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting.
 Failing to properly encode for JavaScript the API method
 t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue(), it is susceptible to Cross-Site
 Scripting. Note: Developers should never rely on the blacklist of
 RemoveXSS() alone, but should always properly encode user input
 before outputting it again.
