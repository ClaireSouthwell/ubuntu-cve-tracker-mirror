Description:
 The chunked transfer coding implementation in the Apache HTTP Server before
 2.4.14 does not properly parse chunk headers, which allows remote attackers
 to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a crafted request, related to
 mishandling of large chunk-size values and invalid chunk-extension
 characters in modules/http/http_filters.c.
