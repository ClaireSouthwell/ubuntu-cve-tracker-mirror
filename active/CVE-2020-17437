Description: 
 When TCP Urgent flag is set in a TCP packet, and the stack is
 configured to ignore the urgent data, the stack will attempt to use
 the value of the Urgent pointer bytes to separate the Urgent data
 from the normal data by calculating the offset at which the normal
 data should be present in the global buffer. The problem is that the
 length of this offset is not checked, therefore for large values of
 the Urgent pointer bytes, the data pointer can point to some memory
 that is way beyond the data buffer. Also the length of the normal
 TCP data is not validated.
 .
 This means that individual applicatons (e.g., httpd, telnetd, etc)
 will get the wrong pointer and wrong TCP data length. Since it is up
 to individual applications how to process this data, the potential
 impact may vary: from getting junk data from memory (Out-of-bounds
 read -> Information leak / DoS) to writing into memory (Out-of-bounds
 write -> DoS / RCE).
