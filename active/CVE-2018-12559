Description:
 An issue was discovered in the cantata-mounter D-Bus service in Cantata
 through 2.3.1. The mount target path check in mounter.cpp `mpOk()` is
 insufficient. A regular user can consequently mount a CIFS filesystem
 anywhere (e.g., outside of the /home directory tree) by passing directory
 traversal sequences such as a home/../usr substring.
