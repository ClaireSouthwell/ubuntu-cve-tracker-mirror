Description:
 The dissect_server_info function in epan/dissectors/packet-ms-mms.c in the
 MS-MMS dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.14 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6
 does not properly manage string lengths, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via a malformed packet that
 (1) triggers an integer overflow or (2) has embedded '\0' characters in a
 string.
