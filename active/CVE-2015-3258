Description: 
 A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the way the texttopdf
 utility of cups-filters processed print jobs with a specially crafted
 line size. An attacker being able to submit print jobs could exploit this
 flaw to crash texttopdf or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the 'lp' user.
