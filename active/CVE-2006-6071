Candidate: CVE-2006-6071
References:
Description:
 TWiki 4.0.5 and earlier, when running under Apache 1.3 using ApacheLogin
 with sessions and "ErrorDocument 401" redirects to a valid wiki topic, does
 not properly handle failed login attempts, which allows remote attackers to
 read arbitrary content by cancelling out of a failed authentication with a
 valid username and invalid password.
