Description:
 An issue was discovered in mod_alias_physical_handler in mod_alias.c in
 lighttpd before 1.4.50. There is potential ../ path traversal of a single
 directory above an alias target, with a specific mod_alias configuration
 where the matched alias lacks a trailing '/' character, but the alias
 target filesystem path does have a trailing '/' character.
