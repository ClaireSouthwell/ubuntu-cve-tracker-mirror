Description:
 A poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's
 reactor and create a denial of service attack. If more keepalive
 connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional
 connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently
 enough.
