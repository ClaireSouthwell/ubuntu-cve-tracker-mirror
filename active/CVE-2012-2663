Description:
 extensions/libxt_tcp.c in iptables through 1.4.21 does not match TCP
 SYN+FIN packets in --syn rules, which might allow remote attackers to
 bypass intended firewall restrictions via crafted packets.  NOTE: the
 CVE-2012-6638 fix makes this issue less relevant.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> This is an iptables userspace issue. A kernel CVE may also be
  assigned, but it will be under a different CVE identifier.
