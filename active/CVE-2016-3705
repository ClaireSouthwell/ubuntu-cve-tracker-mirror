Description:
 The (1) xmlParserEntityCheck and (2) xmlParseAttValueComplex functions in
 parser.c in libxml2 2.9.3 do not properly keep track of the recursion
 depth, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (stack consumption and application crash) via a crafted XML
 document containing a large number of nested entity references.
