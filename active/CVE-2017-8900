Description: 
 Processes launched under a lightdm guest session are not confined by the
 /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-guest-session AppArmor profile in Ubuntu 16.10 and
 Ubuntu 17.04. A physically present attacker can use this issue to log in under
 a guest session to access files and possibly other resources that they would
 not typically have access to. This includes files in the home directory of
 other users since, by default, home directories in Ubuntu are world readable.

Notes: 
 tyhicks> This issue was introduced when the user session handling moved from
  upstart to systemd in Ubuntu 16.10.
