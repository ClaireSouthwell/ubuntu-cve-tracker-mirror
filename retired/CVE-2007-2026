Description:
 The gnu regular expression code in file 4.20 allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted
 document with a large number of line feed characters, which is not well
 handled by OS/2 REXX regular expressions that use wildcards, as originally
 reported for AMaViS.
