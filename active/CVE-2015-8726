Description:
 wiretap/vwr.c in the VeriWave file parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9
 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate certain signature and Modulation
 and Coding Scheme (MCS) data, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted
 file.
