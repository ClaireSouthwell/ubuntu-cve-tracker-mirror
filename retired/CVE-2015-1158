Description: 
 Cupsd uses reference-counted strings with global scope. When parsing a
 print job request, cupsd over-decrements the reference count for a
 string from the request. As a result, an attacker can prematurely free
 an arbitrary string of global scope. They can use this to dismantle
 ACLs protecting privileged operations, and upload a replacement
 configuration file, and subsequently run arbitrary code on a target
 machine.
