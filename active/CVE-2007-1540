Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in am.pl in (1) SQL-Ledger 2.6.27 and
 earlier, and (2) LedgerSMB before 1.2.0, allows remote attackers to run
 arbitrary executables and bypass authentication via a .. (dot dot) sequence
 and trailing NULL (%00) in the login parameter.  NOTE: this issue was
 reportedly addressed in SQL-Ledger 2.6.27, however third-party researchers
 claim that the file is still executed even though an error is generated.
