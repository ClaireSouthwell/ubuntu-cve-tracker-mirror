Description:
 http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok in Lib/http/cookiejar.py in
 Python before 3.7.3 does not correctly validate the domain: it can be
 tricked into sending existing cookies to the wrong server. An attacker may
 abuse this flaw by using a server with a hostname that has another valid
 hostname as a suffix (e.g., pythonicexample.com to steal cookies for
 example.com). When a program uses http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy and tries to
 do an HTTP connection to an attacker-controlled server, existing cookies
 can be leaked to the attacker. This affects 2.x through 2.7.16, 3.x before
 3.4.10, 3.5.x before 3.5.7, 3.6.x before 3.6.9, and 3.7.x before 3.7.3.
