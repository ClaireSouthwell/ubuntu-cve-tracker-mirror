Description: 
 A token expiration date can be circumvented by continuously creating new
 tokens before the old one has expired. Existing tokens also remain valid after
 a user account is disabled or after an account password changed. An
 authenticated and authorized user could potentially leverage those
 vulnerabilities to extend his access beyond the account owner expectations.
