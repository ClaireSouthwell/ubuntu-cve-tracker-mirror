Description:
 functions/mime.php in SquirrelMail before 1.4.18 does not protect the
 application's content from Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) positioning in HTML
 e-mail messages, which allows remote attackers to spoof the user interface,
 and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) and phishing attacks, via a crafted
 message.
