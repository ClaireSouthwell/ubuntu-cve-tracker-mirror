Description:
 A security flaw was found in the XMPP Dialback protocol implementation of
 jabberd2, OpenSource server implementation of the Jabber protocols (Verify
 Response and Authorization Response were not checked within XMPP protocol
 server to server session). A rogue XMPP server could use this flaw to spoof one
 or more domains, when communicating with vulnerable server implementation,
 possibly leading into XMPP's Server Dialback protections bypass.
