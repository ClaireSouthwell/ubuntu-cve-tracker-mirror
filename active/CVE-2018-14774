Description:
 An issue was discovered in HttpKernel in Symfony 2.7.0 through 2.7.48,
 2.8.0 through 2.8.43, 3.3.0 through 3.3.17, 3.4.0 through 3.4.13, 4.0.0
 through 4.0.13, and 4.1.0 through 4.1.2. When using HttpCache, the values
 of the X-Forwarded-Host headers are implicitly set as trusted while this
 should be forbidden, leading to potential host header injection.
