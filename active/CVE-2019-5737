Description:
 An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing an HTTP or
 HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by sending headers very slowly
 thereby keeping the connection and associated resources alive for a long
 period of time. Attack potential is mitigated by the use of a load balancer
 or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121,
 addressed in November and impacts all active release lines including 6, 8,
 10 and 11.
