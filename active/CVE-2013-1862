Description:
 It was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from
 its log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive,
 a remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject
 terminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed
 the log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command
 execution with the privileges of that user.
