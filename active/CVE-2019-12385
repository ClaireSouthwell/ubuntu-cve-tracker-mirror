Description:
 An issue was discovered in Ampache through 3.9.1. The search engine is
 affected by a SQL Injection, so any user able to perform
 lib/class/search.class.php searches (even guest users) can dump any data
 contained in the database (sessions, hashed passwords, etc.). This may lead
 to a full compromise of admin accounts, when combined with the weak
 password generator algorithm used in the lostpassword functionality.
