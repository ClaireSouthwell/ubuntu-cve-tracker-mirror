Candidate: CVE-2005-0739
References:
Description:
 The IAPP dissector (packet-iapp.c) for Ethereal 0.9.1 to 0.10.9 does not
 properly use certain routines for formatting strings, which could leave it
 vulnerable to buffer overflows, as demonstrated using modified length
 values that are not properly handled by the the dissect_pdus and
 pduval_to_str functions.
