Description:
 Vulnerability in the Keystone memcache token backend. When a trustor issues a
 trust token with impersonation enabled, the token is only added to the
 trustor's token list and not to the trustee's token list. This results in the
 trust token not being invalidated by the trustee's token revocation (bulk
 revocation). This is most noticeable when the trustee user is disabled or the
 trustee changes a password. Only setups using the memcache backend for tokens
 in Keystone are affected.
