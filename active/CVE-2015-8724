Description:
 The AirPDcapDecryptWPABroadcastKey function in epan/crypt/airpdcap.c in the
 802.11 dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1
 does not verify the WPA broadcast key length, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via
 a crafted packet.
