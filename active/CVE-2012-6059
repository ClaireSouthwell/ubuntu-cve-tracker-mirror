Description:
 The dissect_isakmp function in epan/dissectors/packet-isakmp.c in the
 ISAKMP dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.12 and 1.8.x before 1.8.4
 uses an incorrect data structure to determine IKEv2 decryption parameters,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) via a malformed packet.
