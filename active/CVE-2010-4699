Description:
 The iconv_mime_decode_headers function in the Iconv extension in PHP before
 5.3.4 does not properly handle encodings that are unrecognized by the iconv
 and mbstring (aka Multibyte String) implementations, which allows remote
 attackers to trigger an incomplete output array, and possibly bypass spam
 detection or have unspecified other impact, via a crafted Subject header in
 an e-mail message, as demonstrated by the ks_c_5601-1987 character set.
