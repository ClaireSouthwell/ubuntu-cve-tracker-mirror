Description:
 In NatHack between 3.6.0 and 3.6.3, a buffer overflow issue exists when
 reading very long lines from a NetHack configuration file (usually named
 .nethackrc). This vulnerability affects systems that have NetHack installed
 suid/sgid and shared systems that allow users to upload their own
 configuration files. All users are urged to upgrade to NetHack 3.6.4 as
 soon as possible.
