Description:
 The csnStreamDissector function in epan/dissectors/packet-csn1.c in the
 CSN.1 dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5
 does not properly handle a large number of padding bits, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a
 malformed packet.
