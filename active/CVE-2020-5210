Description:
 In NetHack before 3.6.5, an invalid argument to the -w command line option
 can cause a buffer overflow resulting in a crash or remote code
 execution/privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects systems that
 have NetHack installed suid/sgid and shared systems that allow users to
 influence command line options. Users should upgrade to NetHack 3.6.5.
