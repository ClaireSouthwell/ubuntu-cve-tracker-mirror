Description:
 Openswan 2.2.x does not properly restrict permissions for (1)
 /var/run/starter.pid, related to starter.c in the IPsec starter, and (2)
 /var/lock/subsys/ipsec, which allows local users to kill arbitrary
 processes by writing a PID to a file, or possibly bypass disk quotas by
 writing arbitrary data to a file, as demonstrated by files with 0666
 permissions, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1784.
