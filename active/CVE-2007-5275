Description:
 The Adobe Macromedia Flash 9 plug-in allows remote attackers to cause a
 victim machine to establish TCP sessions with arbitrary hosts via a Flash
 (SWF) movie, related to lack of pinning of a hostname to a single IP
 address after receiving an allow-access-from element in a
 cross-domain-policy XML document, and the availability of a Flash Socket
 class that does not use the browser's DNS pins, aka DNS rebinding attacks,
 a different issue than CVE-2002-1467 and CVE-2007-4324.
