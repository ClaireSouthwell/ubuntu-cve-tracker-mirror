Description:
 The EditCSVAction function in cgi/actions.py in Roundup 1.2 before 1.2.1,
 1.4 through 1.4.6, and possibly other versions does not properly check
 permissions, which allows remote authenticated users with edit or create
 privileges for a class to modify arbitrary items within that class, as
 demonstrated by editing all queries, modifying settings, and adding roles
 to users.
