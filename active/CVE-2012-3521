Description:
 A directory traversal and information disclosure (local file
 inclusion) flaws were found in the cssgen contrib module (application
 to generate custom CSS files) of GeSHi, a generic syntax highlighter,
 performed sanitization of 'geshi-path' and 'geshi-lang-path' HTTP GET
 / POST variables. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
 URL that, when visited could lead to local file system traversal or,
 potentially, ability to read content of any local file, accessible
 with the privileges of the user running the webserver.
