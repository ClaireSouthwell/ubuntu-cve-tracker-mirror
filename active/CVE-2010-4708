Description:
 The pam_env module in Linux-PAM (aka pam) 1.1.2 and earlier reads the
 .pam_environment file in a user's home directory, which might allow local
 users to run programs with an unintended environment by executing a program
 that relies on the pam_env PAM check.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> this changes default behaviour, after discussion with
 mdeslaur> slangasek, we should change this to match upstream in devel
 mdeslaur> release, but not in stable releases.
