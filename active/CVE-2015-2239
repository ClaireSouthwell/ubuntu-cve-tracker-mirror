Description:
 Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, when Instant Extended mode is used, does
 not properly consider the interaction between the "1993 search" features
 and restore-from-disk RELOAD transitions, which makes it easier for remote
 attackers to spoof the address bar for a search-results page by leveraging
 (1) a compromised search engine or (2) an XSS vulnerability in a search
 engine, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1231.
