Description: 
 svnserve takes a --pid-file option which creates a file containing the
 process id it is running as. It does not take steps to ensure that the
 file it has been directed at is not a symlink. If the pid file is in
 a directory writeable by unprivileged users, the destination could be
 replaced by a symlink allowing for privilege escalation. svnserve does
 not create a pid file by default.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sarnold> I did not spot any init scripts or cron scripts to start svnserve
  at all; local installations would need to start svnserve themselves.
