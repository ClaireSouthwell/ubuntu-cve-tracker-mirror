Description:
 The command matching functionality in sudo 1.6.8 through 1.7.2p5 does not
 properly handle when a file in the current working directory has the same
 name as a pseudo-command in the sudoers file and the PATH contains an entry
 for ".", which allows local users to execute arbitrary commands via a
 Trojan horse executable, as demonstrated using sudoedit, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2010-0426.
