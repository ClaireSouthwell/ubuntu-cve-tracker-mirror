Description: 
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sbeattie> krb5-appl was split out from the krb5 package between hardy
 sbeattie> and lucid by upstream; the CVE covers two issues:
 sbeattie>   * the configure test for setegid() wasn't included when
 sbeattie>     krb5-appl was split out and so setegid is defined to
 sbeattie>     always return an error, which thus doesn't affect hardy
 sbeattie>   * the code never checks the return value of setegid, which
 sbeattie>     is a problem when setegid always fails, but less so when
 sbeattie>     the setegid() is a real call, though still a real issue.
 sbeattie>     hardy is affected by this, but less so than the split out
 sbeattie>     krb5-appl packages.
 sbeattie> Therefore I'm marking this priority low for hardy, for the
 sbeattie> newer releases (in universe), it's more like medium.
