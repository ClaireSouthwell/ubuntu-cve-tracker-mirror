Description:
 OpenSSL server code for ephemeral ECDH ciphersuites is not thread-safe, and
 furthermore can crash if a client violates the protocol by sending handshake
 messages in incorrect order.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> from upstream: applications are only affected by the CRL checking
  vulnerability if they enable OpenSSL's internal CRL checking which is off by
  default. For example by setting the verification flag X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK
  or X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL
 jdstrand> The following packages in main use this X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK*
  curl, dovecot, exim4, freeradius, ipsec-tools
 jdstrand> the above need to also support ECDH to be affected
