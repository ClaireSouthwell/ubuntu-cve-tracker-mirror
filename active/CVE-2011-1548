Description:
 The default configuration of logrotate on Debian GNU/Linux uses root
 privileges to process files in directories that permit non-root write
 access, which allows local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks
 by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted directories, as
 demonstrated by /var/log/postgresql/.
