Description:
 The _gdGetColors function in gd_gd.c in PHP 5.2.11 and 5.3.0, and the GD
 Graphics Library 2.x, does not properly verify a certain colorsTotal
 structure member, which might allow remote attackers to conduct buffer
 overflow or buffer over-read attacks via a crafted GD file, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2009-3293.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained
 from third party information.
