Description: 
 A security flaw was found in the way Dovecot, an IMAP and POP3 email
 server, performed remote server identity verification (x509
 certificate's Common Name field was not checked to match provided
 remote server host name), when Dovecot was configured to proxy IMAP and
 POP3 connections to remote hosts and TLS/SSL protocols were requested
 (ssl=yes or starttls=yes) in the configuration to secure these
 connections to the destination server. A remote attacker could use
 this flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via specially-
 crafted x509v3 certificate.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes:
 jdstrand> SSL proxy connections were added in some Dovecot v1.x versions, but
  but v1.x doesn't support giving hostname as proxy destination, only IP
  address. (per upstream)
