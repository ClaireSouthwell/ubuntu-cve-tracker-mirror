From https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/ContainerArchitecture:

"On the Ubuntu Touch images we run the Android HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
in a container to make use of the binary drivers and some daemons that are
needed to drive the builtin hardware of a phone."

The current approach is, as mentioned, to start a container with the Android
HAL, and then applications use libhybris to talk to the container. On Ubuntu
Touch, typically the only applications needing to talk to the container are
services rather than the apps themselves (ie, the app talks to a service (eg,
media-hub, media-hub uses the libhybris API, which then talks to the
container).

The contents of the container are a pruned set of binaries from the 'android'
source package (in multiverse) and can be found in /system on an AOSP (Android
Open Source Project) based system. As such, Android CVEs may affect Ubuntu
under certain circumstances.

The projects that the android source package pulls from are: Android Open
Source Project, CyanogenMod, and ClockworkMod.
