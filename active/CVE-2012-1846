Description:
 Google Chrome 17.0.963.66 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass the
 sandbox protection mechanism by leveraging access to a sandboxed process,
 as demonstrated by VUPEN during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2012.
 NOTE: the primary affected product may be clarified later; it was not
 identified by the researcher, who reportedly stated "it really doesn't
 matter if it's third-party code."
