Description:
 Poul-Henning Kamp md5crypt has insufficient algorithmic complexity and a
 consequently short runtime, which makes it easier for context-dependent
 attackers to discover cleartext passwords via a brute-force attack, as
 demonstrated by an attack using GPU hardware.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> As of 8.10, Ubuntu has moved away from using MD5 in a security
  context. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features for details.
