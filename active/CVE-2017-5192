Description:
 local_batch client external authentication not respected

 The LocalClient.cmd_batch() method client does not accept external_auth
 credentials and so access to it from salt-api has been removed for
 now. This vulnerability allows code execution for already-authenticated
 users and is only in effect when running salt-api as the root user.
