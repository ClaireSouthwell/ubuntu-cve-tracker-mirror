Description:
 The PointGFp constructor did not check that the affine coordinate
 arguments were less than the prime, but then in curve multiplication
 assumed that both arguments if multiplied would fit into an integer
 twice the size of the prime.

 The bigint_mul and bigint_sqr functions received the size of the
 output buffer, but only used it to dispatch to a faster algorithm
 in cases where there was sufficient output space to call an unrolled
 multiplication function.

 The result is a heap overflow accessible via ECC point decoding, which
 accepted untrusted inputs. This is likely exploitable for remote code
 execution.
