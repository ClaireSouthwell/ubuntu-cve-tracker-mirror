Description:
 SQL injection vulnerability in mod_auth_mysql.c in the mod-auth-mysql (aka
 libapache2-mod-auth-mysql) module for the Apache HTTP Server 2.x, when
 configured to use a multibyte character set that allows a \ (backslash) as
 part of the character encoding, allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified inputs in a login request.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Specifying an encoding was introduced by the 012-charset.dpatch
 mdeslaur> patch in 4.3.9-10. Since we don't support specifying an encoding
 mdeslaur> mysql won't decode the username and injection is not possible.
