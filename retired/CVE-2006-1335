Description:
 gnome screensaver before 2.14, when running on an X server with
 AllowDeactivateGrabs and AllowClosedownGrabs enabled, allows attackers with
 physical access to cause the screensaver to crash and access the session
 via the Ctl+Alt+Keypad-Multiply keyboard sequence, which removes the grab
 from gnome.
