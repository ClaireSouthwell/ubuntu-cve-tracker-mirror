Description:
 The installer in PEAR 1.9.2 and earlier allows local users to overwrite
 arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the package.xml file, related to
 the (1) download_dir, (2) cache_dir, (3) tmp_dir, and (4)
 pear-build-download directories.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
 of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1072.
