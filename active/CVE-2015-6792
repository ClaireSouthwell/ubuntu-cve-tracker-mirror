Description:
 The MIDI subsystem in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.106 does not properly
 handle the sending of data, which allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via
 unspecified vectors, related to midi_manager.cc, midi_manager_alsa.cc, and
 midi_manager_mac.cc, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-8664.
