Description:
 The crypto/x509 package of Go before 1.10.6 and 1.11.x before 1.11.3 does
 not limit the amount of work performed for each chain verification, which
 might allow attackers to craft pathological inputs leading to a CPU denial
 of service. Go TLS servers accepting client certificates and TLS clients
 are affected.
