Candidate: CVE-2005-3416
References:
Description:
 phpBB 2.0.17 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled and the
 session_start function has not been called to handle a session, allows
 remote attackers to bypass security checks by setting the $_SESSION and
 $HTTP_SESSION_VARS variables to strings instead of arrays, which causes an
 array_merge function call to fail.
