Description:
 Change 4885 inadvertently caused "update-policy" rules of type "subdomain"
 to be treated as if they were of type "zonesub", allowing updates to all
 parts of the zone along with the intended subdomain.  An attacker who has
 been granted privileges to change a specific subset of the zone's content
 could abuse these unintended additional privileges to update other contents
 of the zone.
