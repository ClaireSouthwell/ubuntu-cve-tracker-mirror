 https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox/pull/446
Description:
 libhttp/url.c in shellinabox through 2.20 has an implementation flaw in the
 HTTP request parsing logic. By sending a crafted multipart/form-data HTTP
 request, an attacker could exploit this to force shellinaboxd into an
 infinite loop, exhausting available CPU resources and taking the service
 down.
