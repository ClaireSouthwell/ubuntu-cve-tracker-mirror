Description: 
 A remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a libzmq application, running
 with a socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, may cause
 a stack overflow and overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer
 overflow in the library. Users running public servers with the above
 configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there
 are no known mitigations. All versions from 4.0.0 and upwards are affected.
