Description:
 HTTP response splitting, which can act as a cross-site scripting
 vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious
 HTMLs to pages served by Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to
 escalate his privileges by hijacking sessions of other users. To mount
 this attack, the attacker needs to know the exact URL of your Jenkins
 installation. This vulnerability affects those who run Jenkins on its
 built-in servlet container (this includes all the native packages.)
