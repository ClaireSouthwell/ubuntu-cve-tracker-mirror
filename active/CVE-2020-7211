Description: 
 A potential directory traversal issue was found in the tftp server of the
 SLiRP user-mode networking implementation used by QEMU. It could occur on
 Windows host, as it allows to use both forward ('/') and backward
 slash('\') tokens as separators in a file path. A user able to access the
 tftp server could use this flaw to access undue files by using relative
 paths.
