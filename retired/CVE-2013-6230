 BIND 9.6-ESV before 9.6-ESV-R10-P1, 9.8 before 9.8.6-P1, 9.9 before
 9.9.4-P1, 9.9.3-S1, 9.9.4-S1, and other products, does not properly support
 the SIO_GET_INTERFACE_LIST command for netmask 255.255.255.255, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass intended IP address restrictions by
 leveraging misinterpretation of this netmask as a 0.0.0.0 netmask.
