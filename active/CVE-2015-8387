Description:
 PCRE before 8.38 mishandles (?123) subroutine calls and related subroutine
 calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer
 overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular
 expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by
 Konqueror.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> Issue affects PCRE3 only

  expressions which is not very likely
