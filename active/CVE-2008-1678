Description:
 Memory leak in the zlib_stateful_init function in crypto/comp/c_zlib.c in
 libssl in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8h allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (memory consumption) via multiple calls, as demonstrated
 by initial SSL client handshakes to the Apache HTTP Server mod_ssl that
 specify a compression algorithm.
