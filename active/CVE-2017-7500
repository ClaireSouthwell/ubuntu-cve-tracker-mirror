Description:
 It was found that rpm did not properly handle RPM installations when a
 destination path was a symbolic link to a directory, possibly changing
 ownership and permissions of an arbitrary directory, and RPM files being
 placed in an arbitrary destination. An attacker, with write access to a
 directory in which a subdirectory will be installed, could redirect that
 directory to an arbitrary location and gain root privilege.
