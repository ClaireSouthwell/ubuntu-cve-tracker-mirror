Description:
 The dissect_CPMSetBindings function in epan/dissectors/packet-mswsp.c in
 the MS-WSP dissector in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate the
 column size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory consumption or application crash) via a crafted packet.
