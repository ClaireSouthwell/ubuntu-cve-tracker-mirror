Description:
 The resolver in ISC BIND 9 through 9.8.1-P1 overwrites cached server names
 and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A
 record query, which allows remote attackers to trigger continued
 resolvability of revoked domain names via a "ghost domain names" attack.
