Description:
 The wait_for_child_to_die function in main/event.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.x
 before 2.1.10, in certain circumstances involving long-term database
 outages, does not properly handle long queue times for requests, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by
 sending many requests.
