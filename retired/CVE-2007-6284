Description: 
 There exists a denial of service problem in libxml's UTF-8
 decoding functions. The xmlCurrentChar() function does not check
 UTF-8 correctness and certain multibyte combinations can cause
 the library to enter an infinite loop and hang, consuming
 system resources. It is strongly recommended to upgrade if
 your application accepts arbitrary xml user input.
