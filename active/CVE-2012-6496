Description:
 SQL injection vulnerability in the Active Record component in Ruby on Rails
 before 3.0.18, 3.1.x before 3.1.9, and 3.2.x before 3.2.10 allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted request that
 leverages incorrect behavior of dynamic finders in applications that can
 use unexpected data types in certain find_by_ method calls.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> in Oneiric+, rails package is just for transition
 sarnold> The authlogic gem was frequently cited as the problem in early
 sarnold> reports, but the problem is with core Active Record. authlogic
 sarnold> was just one vector known to allow exploiting the problem.
 sarnold> CVE-2012-5664 was rejected as a result of the confusion.
