Description:
 The cairo library (libcairo), as used in GNOME Evolution and possibly other
 products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent
 client crash) via an attached text file that contains "Content-Disposition:
 inline" in the header, and a very long line in the body, which causes the
 client to repeatedly crash until the e-mail message is manually removed,
 possibly due to a buffer overflow, as demonstrated using an XML attachment.
