Description:
 The Chrome Web Store inline-installation implementation in the Extensions
 subsystem in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82 does not properly consider
 object lifetimes during progress observation, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a crafted web site.
