 https://github.com/libming/libming/issues/121
Description:
 The pushdup function in util/decompile.c in libming through 0.4.8 does not
 recognize the need for ActionPushDuplicate to perform a deep copy when a
 String is at the top of the stack, making the library vulnerable to a
 util/decompile.c getName NULL pointer dereference, which may allow
 attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted SWF file.
