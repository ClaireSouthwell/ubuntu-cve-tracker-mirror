Description: 
 When making REST api calls, the puppet master takes YAML from an untrusted
 client, deserializes it, and then calls methods on the resulting object. A
 YAML payload can be crafted to cause the deserialization to construct an
 instance of any class available in the ruby process, which allows an
 attacker to execute code contained in the payload.
