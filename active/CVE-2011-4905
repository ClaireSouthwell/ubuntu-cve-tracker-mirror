Description: 
 A flaw in Apache ActiveMQ before 5.6.0 could allow a remote unauthenticated
 attacker to abuse the 'failover' feature, allowing them to trigger a denial of
 service against the broker service.  An attacker can issue multiple ActiveMQ
 openwire connection requests using the string 'failover:tcp://[IP]:61616', and
 due to the 'failure' mechanism, all TCP connections remain active even if a
 valid session is not created.  After a few thousand requests, a
 'java.net.SocketException: Too many open files' exception is triggered, leading
 to a freeze or crash of the broker (and possibly connected systems as well).
