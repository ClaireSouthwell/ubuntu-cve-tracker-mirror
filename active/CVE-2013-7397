 https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/352
Description:
 Async Http Client (aka AHC or async-http-client) before 1.9.0 skips X.509
 certificate verification unless both a keyStore location and a trustStore
 location are explicitly set, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
 spoof HTTPS servers by presenting an arbitrary certificate during use of a
 typical AHC configuration, as demonstrated by a configuration that does not
 send client certificates.
