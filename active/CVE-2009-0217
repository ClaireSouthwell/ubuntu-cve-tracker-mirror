Description:
 The design of the W3C XML Signature Syntax and Processing (XMLDsig)
 recommendation, as implemented in products including (1) the Oracle
 Security Developer Tools component in Oracle Application Server 10.1.2.3,
 10.1.3.4, and 10.1.4.3IM; (2) the WebLogic Server component in BEA Product
 Suite 10.3, 10.0 MP1, 9.2 MP3, 9.1, 9.0, and 8.1 SP6; (3) Mono before
 2.4.2.2; (4) XML Security Library before 1.2.12; (5) IBM WebSphere
 Application Server Versions 6.0 through 6.0.2.33, 6.1 through 6.1.0.23, and
 7.0 through 7.0.0.1; and other products uses a parameter that defines an
 HMAC truncation length (HMACOutputLength) but does not require a minimum
 for this length, which allows attackers to spoof HMAC-based signatures and
 bypass authentication by specifying a truncation length with a small number
 of bits.
