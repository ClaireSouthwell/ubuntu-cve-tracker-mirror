For these scripts to sucessfully load data into prometheus or Influx for the
KPIs, the system has to be connected to the Canonical VPN.

Also the various passwords need to be supplied via ~/.ubuntu-security-tools.conf:

ubuntu_hardened_admin_password="XXXXX"
ubuntu_security_announce_admin_password="XXXXX"
influxdb_security_password="XXXXX"

The main script to run is update.sh (this should be run every 24 hours) - this
will in turn run the following scripts

sponsors.sh -> Security Updates Available to Sponsor
usn-push.sh -> USN Publication
push-package-cve-count.sh -> Top Packages by CVE Count in Trusty and 
                             CVE Count by Package in Xenial
push-package-count.sh -> Packages Updated in Xenial and
                         Packages Updated in Trusty and
                         Packages Updated in <...>
