Candidate: CVE-2007-4783
References: 
Description: 
 The iconv_substr function in PHP 5.2.4 and earlier allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause (1) a denial of service (application crash) via a long
 string in the charset parameter, probably also requiring a long string in the
 str parameter; or (2) a denial of service (temporary application hang) via a
 long string in the str parameter. NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability in
 most web server environments that support multiple threads, unless these issues
 can be demonstrated for code execution.
