Description:
 php_imap.c in PHP 5.2.5, 5.2.6, 4.x, and other versions, uses obsolete API
 calls that allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long IMAP request, which
 triggers an "rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow" error message.
