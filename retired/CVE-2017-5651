Description:
 The refactoring of the HTTP connectors for 8.5.x onwards, introduced a
 regression in the send file processing. If the send file processing
 completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the
 processor cache twice. This could result in the same Processor being
 used for multiple requests which in turn could lead to unexpected errors
 and/or response mix-up.
