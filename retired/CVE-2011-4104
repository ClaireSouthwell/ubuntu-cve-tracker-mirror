Description:
 It was discovered that both Piston and Tastypie share a similar vulnerability
 with respect to their de-serialization of YAML post data. Both Piston and
 Tastypie used the yaml.load method, which is unsafe. In certain circumstances
 this could be used to allow remote execution of arbitrary code. The updated
 versions, released today, correctly use the yaml.safe_load method, which
 prevents remote code execution. Servers without the yaml module installed are
 not affected. Regardless, we recommend that all users of Piston or Tastypie
 upgrade immediately.
