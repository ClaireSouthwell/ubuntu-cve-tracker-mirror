Description:
 The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
 GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to a global buffer over-read error because
 of an assumption made by code that runs for objcopy and strip, that
 SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections are always named starting with a .rel/.rela
 prefix. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of
 binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy and strip, to
 crash.
