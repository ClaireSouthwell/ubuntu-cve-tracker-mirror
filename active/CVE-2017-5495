Description:
 All versions of Quagga, 0.93 through 1.1.0, are vulnerable to an unbounded
 memory allocation in the telnet 'vty' CLI, leading to a Denial-of-Service
 of Quagga daemons, or even the entire host. When Quagga daemons are
 configured with their telnet CLI enabled, anyone who can connect to the TCP
 ports can trigger this vulnerability, prior to authentication. Most
 distributions restrict the Quagga telnet interface to local access only by
 default. The Quagga telnet interface 'vty' input buffer grows
 automatically, without bound, so long as a newline is not entered. This
 allows an attacker to cause the Quagga daemon to allocate unbounded memory
 by sending very long strings without a newline. Eventually the daemon is
 terminated by the system, or the system itself runs out of memory. This is
 fixed in Quagga 1.1.1 and Free Range Routing (FRR) Protocol Suite
 2017-01-10.
