Description:
 Apache PDFBox parses different XML data within PDF files such as XMP and
 the initialization of the XML parsers did not protect against XML
 External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities. According to www.owasp.org [1]:
 "This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of
 service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective
 of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts."
