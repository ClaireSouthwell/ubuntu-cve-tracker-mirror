Description:
 Add-on updates failed to verify that the add-on ID inside the signed
 package matched the ID of the add-on being updated. An attacker who
 could perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the user's connection to
 the update server and defeat the certificate pinning protection could
 provide a malicious signed add-on instead of a valid update.
