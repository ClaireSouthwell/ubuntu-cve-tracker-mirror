Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 10 and Update 11 (JRE
 1.7.0_11-b21) and possibly other versions, when running on Windows using
 Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Google Chrome, allows remote
 attackers to bypass the "Very High" security level of the Java Control
 Panel and execute unsigned Java code without prompting the user via unknown
 vectors, aka "Issue 53." NOTE: as of 20130130, this vulnerability does not
 contain any independently-verifiable details, and there is no vendor
 acknowledgement. A CVE identifier is being assigned because this
 vulnerability is receiving significant public attention, and the original
 researcher has an established history of releasing vulnerability reports
 that have been fixed by vendors.
