Description:
 opencryptoki 2.4.1 insecure lock files in /var/lock
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> 2.4.1 moved lock files from /tmp to /var/lock, but /var/lock is
 mdeslaur> world writable on certain distros, such as debian and ubuntu.
 mdeslaur> 2.4.2 moved them to /var/lock/opencryptoki
 mdeslaur> members of the pkcs11 group are considered trusted by upstream
 mdeslaur> and can likely escalate privileges to root even after the upstream
 mdeslaur> patches. See oss-security discussion.
 mdeslaur> Moving this to /var/lock/opencryptoki may make the problem worse
 mdeslaur> for members of the pkcs11 group as that directory wouldn't be
 mdeslaur> covered by symlink restrictions.
