Description:
 Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in core/html/HTMLInputElement.cpp
 in the DOM implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 41.0.2272.76, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger extraneous
 change events, as demonstrated by events for invalid input or input to
 read-only fields, related to the initializeTypeInParsing and updateType
 functions.
