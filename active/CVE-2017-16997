Description:
 elf/dl-load.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.19 through 2.26
 mishandles RPATH and RUNPATH containing $ORIGIN for a privileged (setuid or
 AT_SECURE) program, which allows local users to gain privileges via a
 Trojan horse library in the current working directory, related to the
 fillin_rpath and decompose_rpath functions. This is associated with
 misinterpretion of an empty RPATH/RUNPATH token as the "./" directory.
 NOTE: this configuration of RPATH/RUNPATH for a privileged program is
 apparently very uncommon; most likely, no such program is shipped with any
 common Linux distribution.
