Description:
 A flaw was found in the way Restlet handled deserialization. Restlet
 applications which use ObjectRepresentation to map HTTP request data
 directly to an object deserialize arbitrary user-provided serialized
 data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the
 deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server.
 This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending on the
 deserialization logic of these classes.
