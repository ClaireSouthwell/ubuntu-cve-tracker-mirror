Description:
 Multiple integer underflows in FFmpeg 0.5 allow remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted file
 that (1) bypasses a validation check in vorbis_dec.c and triggers a
 wraparound of the stack pointer, or (2) access a pointer from out-of-bounds
 memory in mov.c, related to an elst tag that appears before a tag that
 creates a stream.
