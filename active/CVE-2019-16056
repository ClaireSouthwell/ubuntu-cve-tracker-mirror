Description:
 An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x
 through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses
 email addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that
 uses the email module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To
 headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address that
 should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however,
 this CVE applies to Python more generally.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> This has a very high risk of regression. Email addresses should
  not be validated beyond making sure there's at least one byte on both
  sides of an '@' sign. Legal email addresses are significantly more
  complicated than what is easy to express in regex.
 sarnold> Whatever validation this module provides is in my opinion suspect.
