Description: 
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that PHP, when used as a stand alone CGI processor
 for the Apache Web Server, did not properly parse and filter query
 strings. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
 running with the privilege of the web server. Configurations using
 mod_php5 and FastCGI were not vulnerable.
Notes: 
 Please see http://www.php.net for more details
 when using configurations other than as described in
 /usr/share/doc/php5-cgi/README.Debian.gz. The php-security.net
 article has an updated set of mod_rewrite rules that can mitigate
 the vulnerability as well:
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^[^=]*$
   RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} %2d|\- [NC]
   RewriteRule .? - [F,L]
