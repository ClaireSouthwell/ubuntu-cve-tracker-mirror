Cron will run update.sh once in a while.  For many of the historical
graphs, the current data is generated each run, but only saved on the
first Sunday run (to keep a historical weekly history).

Update for new release:
- for both supported.data and supported-src.data
  - take the last line of the file and add it above the commented line in the .template file
  - in the .template file, update the commented out release name to next release
  - in the .template file, the new release column header name
  - in the .template file, add a 0 column to all lines (except the last uncommented line), making sure everything is sensible for package counts
- edit update.sh
  - update REL for the new release
  - increment INDEX by 1
- add to .bzrignore:
  - $REL-src.data
  - $REL.data
