Description: 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the doInterval function in regexcmp.cpp in libicu
 in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and earlier allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
 and possibly have unspecified other impact via a regular expression that writes
 a large amount of data to the backtracking stack. NOTE: some of these details
 are obtained from third party information.
