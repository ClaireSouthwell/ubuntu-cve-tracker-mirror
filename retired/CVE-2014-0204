Description: 
 Someone with write access to the user and group repository (such as the
 LDAP directory server) may willingly or unwillingly grant additional
 rights by picking the same IDs for users and groups, resulting in roles
 assigned to a group being assigned to the affected user even if he is
 not a member of this group. Only Keystone setups using LDAP for the
 Identity driver are affected.
