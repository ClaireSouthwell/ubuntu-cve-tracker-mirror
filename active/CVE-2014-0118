Description:
 A resource consumption flaw was found in mod_deflate. If request body
 decompression was configured (using the "DEFLATE" input filter), a remote
 attacker could cause the server to consume significant memory and/or CPU
 resources. The use of request body decompression is not a common
 configuration.
