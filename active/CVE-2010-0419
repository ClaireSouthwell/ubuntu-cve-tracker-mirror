Description:
 The x86 emulator in KVM 83, when a guest is configured for Symmetric
 Multiprocessing (SMP), does not properly restrict writing of segment
 selectors to segment registers, which might allow guest OS users to cause a
 denial of service (guest OS crash) or gain privileges on the guest OS by
 leveraging access to a (1) IO port or (2) MMIO region, and replacing an
 instruction in between emulator entry and instruction fetch.
