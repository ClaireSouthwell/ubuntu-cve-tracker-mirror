Description:
 In Poppler 0.72.0, PDFDoc::setup in PDFDoc.cc allows attackers to cause a
 denial-of-service (application crash caused by Object.h SIGABRT, because of
 a wrong return value from PDFDoc::setup) by crafting a PDF file in which an
 xref data structure is mishandled during extractPDFSubtype processing.
