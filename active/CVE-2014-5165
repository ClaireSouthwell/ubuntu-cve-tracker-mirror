Description:
 The dissect_ber_constrained_bitstring function in
 epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c in the ASN.1 BER dissector in Wireshark 1.10.x
 before 1.10.9 does not properly validate padding values, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer underflow and
 application crash) via a crafted packet.
