Candidate: CVE-2007-5135
References: 
Description: 
 Off-by-one error in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function in OpenSSL
 0.9.7l and 0.9.8d might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 code via a crafted packet that triggers a one-byte buffer underflow.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Moritz Jodeit discovered that OpenSSL's SSL_get_shared_ciphers function
 did not correctly check the size of the buffer it was writing to.
 A remote attacker exploit this to write one NULL byte past the end of
 an application's cipher list buffer, possibly leading to arbitrary code
 execution or a denial of service.
