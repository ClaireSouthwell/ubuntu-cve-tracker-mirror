Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that t1lib does not properly perform bounds checking
 which can result in a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could
 send specially crafted input to applications linked against t1lib which
 could result in a DoS or arbitrary code execution.
Notes:
 jdstrand> while tetex-bin and texlive-bin have embedded t1lib code, it's
   not used
