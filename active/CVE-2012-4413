Description:
 OpenStack Keystone 2012.1.3 does not invalidate existing tokens when
 granting or revoking roles, which allows remote authenticated users to
 retain the privileges of the revoked roles.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Dolph Mathews discovered that when roles are granted and revoked to
 users in Keystone, pre-existing tokens were not updated or invalidated
 to take the new roles into account. An attacker could use this to
 continue to access resources that have been revoked.
Notes:
