Description:
 An issue has been found in the DNSSEC parsing code of PowerDNS Recursor
 from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.0.6 leading to a memory leak when parsing
 specially crafted DNSSEC ECDSA keys. These keys are only parsed when
 validation is enabled by setting dnssec to a value other than off or
 process-no-validate (default).
