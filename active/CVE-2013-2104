Description:
 vulnerability in expiry checks for PKI tokens in the Keystone authentication
 middleware. Expired tokens for authenticated users could continue to be used,
 potentially resulting in the bypass of intended security policies. The effect
 of PKI token revocation is also reversed when the token expires, in the sense
 that a revoked token is once again treated as being valid. Only setups using
 PKI tokens are affected.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per upstream, code introduced in keystone in Folsom (Ubuntu 12.10).
  For Grizzly (13.10), code moved to python-keystoneclient
 jdstrand> PKI tokens not available on Essex (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS)
 jdstrand> PKI are not used by default in Folsom (Ubuntu 12.10)
 jdstrand> For
 jdstrand> upstream patch for python-keystoneclient does not apply cleanly to
  0.2.3 (what we have in 13.04 and 13.10)
 jdstrand> upstream patch for keystone requires a lot of other patches for
  2012.2.3+stable-20130206-82c87e56-0ubuntu2.1 (what is currently in 12.10).
  Once these are applied, there are many testsuite failures that may be
  Ubuntu-specific (openssl errors need to be investigated)
 jdstrand> using upstream patch against 2012.2.4-0ubuntu2 also results in many
  failures
