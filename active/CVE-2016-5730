 phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before

 involving (1) an array value to FormDisplay.php, (2) incorrect data to
 validate.php, (3) unexpected data to Validator.php, (4) a missing config
 directory during setup, or (5) an incorrect OpenID identifier data type,
 which reveals the full path in an error message.
