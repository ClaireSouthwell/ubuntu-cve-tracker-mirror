Description:
 In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through
 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for
 group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against
 unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jj: This appears to be mitigated by kernel symlink restrictions. The
 jj: crontabs dir has the sticky bit set
 jj:    drwx-wx--T root crontab crontabs
 jj: which means symlinks within the dir must have the same uid as the
 jj: target.
 jj: It is still possible that a cron package update could trigger this race.
 sarnold: I believe that actually _exploiting_ the bug requires
 sarnold: updating the cron package. So long as there's no updates for cron,
 sarnold: the vulnerable code doesn't run. So if we find a second bug in
 sarnold: cron then we really should fix the race condition at the same
 sarnold: time, but so long as we don't push a cron update, the vulnerable
 sarnold: code just plain doesn't run.
 sarnold: the patch just narrows the time window for the race condition.
