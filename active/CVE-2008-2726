Description:
 Integer overflow in the (1) rb_ary_splice function in Ruby 1.8.4 and
 earlier, 1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230, 1.8.7 before
 1.8.7-p22, and 1.9.0 before 1.9.0-2; and (2) the rb_ary_replace function in
 1.6.x allows context-dependent attackers to trigger memory corruption, aka
 the "beg + rlen" issue.  NOTE: as of 20080624, there has been inconsistent
 usage of multiple CVE identifiers related to Ruby. The CVE description
 should be regarded as authoritative, although it is likely to change.
