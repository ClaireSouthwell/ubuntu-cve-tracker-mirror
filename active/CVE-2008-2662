Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the rb_str_buf_append function in Ruby 1.8.4
 and earlier, 1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230, 1.8.7 before
 1.8.7-p22, and 1.9.0 before 1.9.0-2 allow context-dependent attackers to
 execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via unknown vectors
 that trigger memory corruption, a different issue than CVE-2008-2663,
 CVE-2008-2664, and CVE-2008-2725.  NOTE: as of 20080624, there has been
 inconsistent usage of multiple CVE identifiers related to Ruby. This CVE
 description should be regarded as authoritative, although it is likely to
 change.
