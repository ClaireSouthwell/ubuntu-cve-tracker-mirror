Candidate: CVE-2007-4174
References: 
Description: 
 Tor before 0.1.2.16, when ControlPort is enabled, does not properly restrict
 commands to localhost port 9051, which allows remote attackers to modify the
 torrc configuration file, compromise anonymity, and have other unspecified
 impact via HTTP POST data containing commands without valid authentication, as
 demonstrated by an HTML form (1) hosted on a web site or (2) injected by a Tor
 exit node.
