Description:
 The Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLI version 1.15.85 (and possibly earlier
 versions) does not require the --owners flag when describing images, which
 makes it easier for remote attackers to trigger the loading of an undesired
 AMI by setting similar image properties (i.e., name), as exploited in the
 wild during August 2018 with a Monero miner AMI instead of the expected
 Ubuntu AMI.
