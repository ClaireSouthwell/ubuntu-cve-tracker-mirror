Candidate: CVE-2005-4618
References: 
Description:
 Buffer overflow in sysctl in the Linux Kernel 2.6 before 2.6.15 allows
 local users to corrupt user memory and possibly cause a denial of service
 via a long string, which causes sysctl to write a zero byte outside the
 buffer.  NOTE: since the sysctl is called from a userland program that
 provides the argument, this might not be a vulnerability, unless a
 legitimate user-assisted or setuid scenario can be identified.
