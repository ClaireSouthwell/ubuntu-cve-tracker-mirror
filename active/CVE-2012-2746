Description:
 It was found that when the password for an LDAP user was changed, and audit
 logging was enabled (it is disabled by default), the new password was
 written to the audit log in plain text form. This update introduces a new
 configuration parameter, "nsslapd-auditlog-logging-hide-unhashed-pw", which
 when set to "on" (the default option), prevents 389 Directory Server from
 writing plain text passwords to the audit log. This option can be
 configured in "/etc/dirsrv/slapd-[ID]/dse.ldif".
