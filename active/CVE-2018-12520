Description:
 An issue was discovered in ntopng 3.4 before 3.4.180617. The PRNG involved
 in the generation of session IDs is not seeded at program startup. This
 results in deterministic session IDs being allocated for active user
 sessions. An attacker with foreknowledge of the operating system and
 standard library in use by the host running the service and the username of
 the user whose session they're targeting can abuse the deterministic random
 number generation in order to hijack the user's session, thus escalating
 their access.
