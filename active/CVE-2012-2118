Description:
 Adding an input device with a malicious name can trigger a format
 string flaw in Xorg's logging subsystem. For builds of Xorg lacking
 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 (or 32-bit systems lacking the fix to fortify[1])
 this can lead to arbitrary code execution as the Xorg user, usually
 root. When built with fortify, this is a denial of service, since Xorg
 will abort.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Reducing priority because we build with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and
  as of USN-1396-1, Ubuntu's glibc is patched to fix (CVE-2012-0864), so this
  is reduced to a denial of service.
