Description:
 A possible remote (or local) code execution were identified in
 the gettext.php file allowing an attacker to gain access on the
 targeted host system and/or gain applicationâ€™s privileges throught
 a specially crafted .mo language file. The $string variable is not
 sufficiently sanitized before to be submitted to eval() function
 (which is dangerous) in select_string() function causing the
 security issue.
