Description:
 The ParamTraits<SkBitmap>::Read function in common/common_param_traits.cc
 in Google Chrome before 4.0.249.78 does not initialize the memory locations
 that will hold bitmap data, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
 potentially sensitive information from process memory by providing
 insufficient data, related to use of a (1) thumbnail database or (2) HTML
 canvas.
