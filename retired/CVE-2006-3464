Description:
 TIFF library (libtiff) before 3.8.2 allows context-dependent attackers to
 pass numeric range checks and possibly execute code, and trigger assert
 errors, via large offset values in a TIFF directory that lead to an integer
 overflow and other unspecified vectors involving "unchecked arithmetic
 operations".
