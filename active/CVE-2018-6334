Description:
 Multipart-file uploads call variables to be improperly registered in the
 global scope. In cases where variables are not declared explicitly before
 being used this can lead to unexpected behavior. This affects all supported
 versions of HHVM prior to the patch (3.25.1, 3.24.5, and 3.21.9 and below).
