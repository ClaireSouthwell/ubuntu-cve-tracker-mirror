Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome 17.0.963.66 and earlier
 allows remote attackers to bypass the DEP and ASLR protection mechanisms,
 and execute arbitrary code, via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by
 VUPEN during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2012. NOTE: the primary
 affected product may be clarified later; it was not identified by the
 researcher, who reportedly stated "it really doesn't matter if it's
 third-party code."
