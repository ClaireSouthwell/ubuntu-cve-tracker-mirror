Description:
 A long-standing bug in the wikitext parser (bug 22555) was discovered to have
 security implications. In the presence of the popular CharInsert extension, it
 leads to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS may be possible with other extensions
 or perhaps even the MediaWiki core alone, although this is not confirmed at
 this time. A denial-of-service attack (infinite loop) is also possible
 regardless of configuration.
