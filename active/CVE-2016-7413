Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the wddx_stack_destroy function in
 ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.26 and 7.x before 7.0.11 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a wddxPacket XML document that lacks an end-tag for a recordset
 field element, leading to mishandling in a wddx_deserialize call.
