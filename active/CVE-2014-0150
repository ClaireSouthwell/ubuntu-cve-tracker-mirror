Description:
 A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way qemu processed MAC addresses
 table update requests from the guest. A privileged guest user could use
 this flaw to corrupt qemu process memory on the host, which could
 potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the
 privileges of the qemu process.
