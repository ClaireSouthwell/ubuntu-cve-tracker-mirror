Description:
 The get_build_id function in opncls.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
 library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and
 application crash) via a crafted file in which a certain size field is
 larger than a corresponding data field, as demonstrated by mishandling
 within the objdump program.
