Embedded code copies
====================

This follows the same format as security-testing/data/embedded-code-copies from
Debian, but contain Ubuntu-specific sources that are not included in Debian
(and will likely never be)

This file collects source packages that embed code from other projects.
This is considered bad for fixing security flaws because the fix needs
to be applied in multiple source packages.

Format:
<srcpkg> (<optional comment about srcpkg>)
	- <embedding srcpkg> <status> (<sort>; bug #<number>)
	NOTE: optional comments about the linkage of the embedding srcpkg

status: version number fixing the embedded copy
	<unfixed> if the issue is not yet fixed
	<removed> if the package was removed from the archive
	<itp> if the package is in the process of being packaged
	<not-affected> if the package does not use the embedded copy
	<unknown> if the version number can not be determined
	<unfixable> for unavoidable cases (e.g., forks that add real value)
sort: static (linking statically against a lib)
      embed (embeds a copy of the library into another source package)
      modified-embed (embeds a code copy that differs from upstream code)
      fork (a full-blown fork of another source package)
      old-version (an older version of essentially the same code)

The srcpkg might be some string to identify the code if there is no
specific source package.

Everything up to the next line is ignored.
