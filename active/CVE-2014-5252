Description:
 When the server converted a V2 token to a V3 token it regenerated
 the issued_at time. This was causing the server to return a different
 issued_at time when a V2 token was validated using the V3 API. This
 was causing the server to fail to revoke a V2 token if it was revoked
 before validating it first because the regenerated token was considered
 to be after the revocation event.
