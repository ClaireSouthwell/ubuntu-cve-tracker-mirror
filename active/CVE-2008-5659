Description:
 The gnu.java.security.util.PRNG class in GNU Classpath 0.97.2 and earlier
 uses a predictable seed based on the system time, which makes it easier for
 context-dependent attackers to conduct brute force attacks against
 cryptographic routines that use this class for randomness, as demonstrated
 against DSA private keys.
