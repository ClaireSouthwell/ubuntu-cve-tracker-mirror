Description:
 QEMU, through version 2.10 and through version 3.1.0, is vulnerable to an
 out-of-bounds read of up to 128 bytes in the hw/i2c/i2c-ddc.c:i2c_ddc()
 function. A local attacker with permission to execute i2c commands could
 exploit this to read stack memory of the qemu process on the host.
