Candidate: CVE-2007-5093
References: 
Description: 
 The disconnect method in the Philips USB Webcam (pwc) driver in Linux kernel
 2.6.x before 2.6.22.6 "relies on user space to close the device," which allows
 user-assisted local attackers to cause a denial of service (USB subsystem hang
 and CPU consumption in khubd) by not closing the device after the disconnect is
 invoked. NOTE: this rarely crosses privilege boundaries, unless the attacker
 can convince the victim to unplug the affected device.
