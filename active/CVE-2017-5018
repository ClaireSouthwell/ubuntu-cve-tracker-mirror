Description:
 Google Chrome prior to 56.0.2924.76 for Linux, Windows and Mac, and
 56.0.2924.87 for Android, had an insufficiently strict content security
 policy on the Chrome app launcher page, which allowed a remote attacker to
 inject scripts or HTML into a privileged page via a crafted HTML page.
