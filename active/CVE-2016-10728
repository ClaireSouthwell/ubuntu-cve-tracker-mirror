Description:
 An issue was discovered in Suricata before 3.1.2. If an ICMPv4 error packet
 is received as the first packet on a flow in the to_client direction, it
 confuses the rule grouping lookup logic. The toclient inspection will then
 continue with the wrong rule group. This can lead to missed detection.
