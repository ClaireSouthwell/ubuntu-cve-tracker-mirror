Description:
 embed/ephy-web-view.c in GNOME Web (aka Epiphany) through 3.31.4 allows
 address bar spoofing because a page load triggered by JavaScript leads to
 updating an address as if it were triggered by a safer visit type (e.g.,
 VISIT_LINK, VISIT_TYPED, VISIT_BOOKMARK, or VISIT_HOMEPAGE). This is
 similar to the CVE-2018-8383 issue in Microsoft Edge.
