Description: 
 Florian Weimer reported that the printbuf APIs used in the json-c
 library used ints for counting buffer lengths, which is inappropriate
 for 32bit architectures.  These functions need to be changed to using
 size_t if possible for sizes, or to be hardened against negative values
 if not.  This could be used to cause a denial of service in an
 application linked to the json-c library.
