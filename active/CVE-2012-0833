Description:
 A flaw was found in the way the 389 Directory Server daemon (ns-slapd)
 handled access control instructions (ACIs) using certificate groups. If an
 LDAP user that had a certificate group defined attempted to bind to the
 directory server, it would cause ns-slapd to enter an infinite loop and
 consume an excessive amount of CPU time.
