Description:
 The PDF functionality in Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and
 Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does not
 properly handle object linkage, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a crafted document.
