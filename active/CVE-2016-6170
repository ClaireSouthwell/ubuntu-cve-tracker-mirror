Description:
 ISC BIND through 9.9.9-P1, 9.10.x through 9.10.4-P1, and 9.11.x through
 9.11.0b1 allows primary DNS servers to cause a denial of service (secondary
 DNS server crash) via a large AXFR response, and possibly allows IXFR
 servers to cause a denial of service (IXFR client crash) via a large IXFR
 response and allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
 (primary DNS server crash) via a large UPDATE message.
