Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The debug handler in Symfony before v2.7.33, 2.8.x before
 v2.8.26, 3.x before v3.2.13, and 3.3.x before v3.3.6 has XSS via an array
 key during exception pretty printing in ExceptionHandler.php, as
 demonstrated by a /_debugbar/open?op=get URI. NOTE: the vendor's position
 is that this is not a vulnerability because the debug tools are not
 intended for production use. NOTE: the Symfony Debug component is used by
 Laravel Debugbar.
