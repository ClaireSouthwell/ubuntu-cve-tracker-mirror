Description:
 A vulnerability was found in the ping functionality of the ws module before
 1.0.0 which allowed clients to allocate memory by sending a ping frame. The
 ping functionality by default responds with a pong frame and the previously
 given payload of the ping frame. This is exactly what you expect, but
 internally ws always transforms all data that we need to send to a Buffer
 instance and that is where the vulnerability existed. ws didn't do any
 checks for the type of data it was sending. With buffers in node when you
 allocate it when a number instead of a string it will allocate the amount
 of bytes.
