Description:
 Apache POI's XLSX2CSV example uses Java's XML components to parse
 OpenXML files.  Applications and users that use XLSX2CSV and accept
 such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
 attacks, which allow remote attackers to bypass security restrictions
 and read arbitrary files via a crafted OpenXML document that provides an
 XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference.
