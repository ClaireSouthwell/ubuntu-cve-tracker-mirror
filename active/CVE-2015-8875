Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the (1) pixops_composite_nearest, (2)
 pixops_composite_color_nearest, and (3) pixops_process functions in
 pixops/pixops.c in gdk-pixbuf before 2.33.1 allow remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
 via a crafted image, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
