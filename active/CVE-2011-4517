Description:
 The jpc_crg_getparms function in libjasper/jpc/jpc_cs.c in JasPer 1.900.1
 uses an incorrect data type during a certain size calculation, which allows
 remote attackers to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and execute
 arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption), via
 a malformed JPEG2000 file.
