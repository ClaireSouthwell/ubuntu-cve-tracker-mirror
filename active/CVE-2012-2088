Description:
 A type-conversion flaw leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was found in
 the way libtiff reads certain tiled tiff files. An attacker could create a
 specially-crafted TIFF image that, when opened, could cause an application
 using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
 privileges of the user running the application.
