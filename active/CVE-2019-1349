Description:
 When using submodule paths that refer to the same file system entity
 (e.g. using the NTFS Alternate Data Streams attack mentioned in
 CVE-2019-1352 where files would be written to the `.git/` directory
 using a synonymous directory name), it was possible to "squat" on the
 `git~1` shortname on NTFS drives, opening attacks via `git~2`. This
 also affects Git when run as a Linux application inside the Windows
 Subsystem for Linux.
