Description:
 When applications running on JBoss Web used the COOKIE session tracking
 method, the org.apache.catalina.connector.Response.encodeURL() method
 returned the URL with the jsessionid appended as a query string parameter
 when processing the first request of a session. An attacker could possibly
 exploit this flaw by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to obtain a
 user's jsessionid and hijack their session, or by extracting the jsessionid
 from log files. Note that no session tracking method is used by default,
 one must be configured.
