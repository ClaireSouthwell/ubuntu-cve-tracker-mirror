Description:
 lib/moodlelib.php in Moodle through 2.5.9, 2.6.x before 2.6.9, 2.7.x before
 2.7.6, and 2.8.x before 2.8.4, when the theme uses the blocks-regions
 feature, establishes the course state at an incorrect point in the
 login-validation process, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 course information via unspecified vectors.
