Description:
 An issue was discovered in Erlang/OTP 18.x. Erlang's generation of compiled
 regular expressions is vulnerable to a heap overflow. Regular expressions
 using a malformed extpattern can indirectly specify an offset that is used
 as an array index. This ordinal permits arbitrary regions within the
 erts_alloc arena to be both read and written to.
