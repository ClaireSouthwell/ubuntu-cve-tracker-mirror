Description:
 The EScript.api plugin in Adobe Acrobat Reader 9.4.0, 8.1.7, and probably
 other versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
 and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF document that
 triggers memory corruption, involving the printSeps function.  NOTE: some
 of these details are obtained from third party information.
