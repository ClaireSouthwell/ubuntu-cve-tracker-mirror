Description:
 The htmlspecialchars function in PHP before 5.2.12 does not properly handle
 (1) overlong UTF-8 sequences, (2) invalid Shift_JIS sequences, and (3)
 invalid EUC-JP sequences, which allows remote attackers to conduct
 cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by placing a crafted byte sequence
 before a special character.
