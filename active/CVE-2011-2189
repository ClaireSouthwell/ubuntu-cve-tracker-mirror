Description:
 It was discovered that Linux kernels < 2.6.35 are considerably slower in
 releasing than in the creation of network namespaces.  As a result of this
 and because vsftpd is using this feature as a security enhancement to
 provide network isolation for connections, it is possible to cause denial
 of service conditions due to excessive memory allocations by the kernel.
 This is technically no vsftpd flaw, but a kernel issue.  However, this
 feature has legitimate use cases and backporting the specific kernel patch
 is too intrusive.  Additionally, a local attacker requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
 capability to abuse this functionality.  Therefore, as a fix, a kernel
 version check has been added to vsftpd in order to disable this feature
 for kernels < 2.6.35.
