Description:
 An issue was discovered in Poppler 0.74.0. A recursive function call, in
 JBIG2Stream::readGenericBitmap() located in JBIG2Stream.cc, can be
 triggered by sending a crafted pdf file to (for example) the pdfseparate
 binary. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service (Segmentation
 fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact. This is related to
 JArithmeticDecoder::decodeBit.
