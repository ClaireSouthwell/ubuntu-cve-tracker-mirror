Description:
 FORM authentication associates the most recent request requiring
 authentication with the current session. By repeatedly sending a request
 for an authenticated resource while the victim is completing the login
 form, an attacker could inject a request that would be executed using
 the victim's credentials. This attack has been prevented by changing the
 session ID prior to displaying the login page as well as after the user
 has successfully authenticated.
