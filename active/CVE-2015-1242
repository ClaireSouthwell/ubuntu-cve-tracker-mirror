Description:
 The ReduceTransitionElementsKind function in hydrogen-check-elimination.cc
 in Google V8 before 4.2.77.8, as used in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that leverages "type
 confusion" in the check-elimination optimization.
