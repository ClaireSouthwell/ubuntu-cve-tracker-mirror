Description:
 The HTTP clients in the (1) httplib, (2) urllib, (3) urllib2, and (4)
 xmlrpclib libraries in CPython (aka Python) 2.x before 2.7.9 and 3.x before
 3.4.3, when accessing an HTTPS URL, do not (a) check the certificate
 against a trust store or verify that the server hostname matches a domain
 name in the subject's (b) Common Name or (c) subjectAltName field of the
 X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
 servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
