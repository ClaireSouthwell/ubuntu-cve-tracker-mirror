Description:
 An unintended cleartext issue exists in Go before 1.8.4 and 1.9.x before
 1.9.1. RFC 4954 requires that, during SMTP, the PLAIN auth scheme must only
 be used on network connections secured with TLS. The original
 implementation of smtp.PlainAuth in Go 1.0 enforced this requirement, and
 it was documented to do so. In 2013, upstream issue #5184, this was changed
 so that the server may decide whether PLAIN is acceptable. The result is
 that if you set up a man-in-the-middle SMTP server that doesn't advertise
 STARTTLS and does advertise that PLAIN auth is OK, the smtp.PlainAuth
 implementation sends the username and password.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
