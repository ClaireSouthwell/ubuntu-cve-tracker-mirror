Candidate: CVE-2007-4783
References: 
Description:
 The iconv_substr function in PHP 5.2.4 and earlier allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause (1) a denial of service (application crash) via a long
 string in the charset parameter, probably also requiring a long string in
 the str parameter; or (2) a denial of service (temporary application hang)
 via a long string in the str parameter.  NOTE: this might not be a
 vulnerability in most web server environments that support multiple
 threads, unless these issues can be demonstrated for code execution.
