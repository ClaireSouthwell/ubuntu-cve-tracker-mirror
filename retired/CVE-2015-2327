 https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-17252
Description:
 PCRE before 8.36 mishandles the /(((a\2)|(a*)\g<-1>))*/ pattern and related
 patterns with certain internal recursive back references, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as
 demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.
