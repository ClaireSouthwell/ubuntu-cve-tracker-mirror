Description:
 Certain storage volume configurations allow newly created volumes to
 contain previous data. This could lead to leakage of sensitive
 information between tenants. 
 This issue was fixed in the openstack/cinder 13.0.0.0b1.
Ubuntu-Description:
 The volume_clear option is not appropriate for scaleio, it's only for
 drivers where the data path is managed by cinder volume (LVM, block
 device driver, etc.)
 If scaleio is provisioning volumes that have pre-existing data on them,
 that is a serious bug in the scaleio backend or driver.
 It should not expose data of previously deleted volumes, and whatever is
 needed to fix that behavior should not be optional.
