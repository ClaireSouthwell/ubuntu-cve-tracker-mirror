Description:
 The dissect_llrp_parameters function in epan/dissectors/packet-llrp.c in
 the LLRP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.10 and 2.0.x before
 2.0.2 does not limit the recursion depth, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (memory consumption or application crash) via a
 crafted packet.
