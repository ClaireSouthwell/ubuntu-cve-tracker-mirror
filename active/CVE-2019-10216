Description:
 It was found that the .buildfont1 procedure did not properly secure its
 privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A
 specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw to escalate its
 privileges and, for example, access files outside of restricted areas.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Netanel Fisher discovered that the font handler in Ghostscript did not
 properly restrict privileged calls when '-dSAFER' restrictions were in
 effect. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
 specially crafted file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue
 to access arbitrary files, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of
 service.
