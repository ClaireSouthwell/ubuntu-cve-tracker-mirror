Description:
 The gss_userok function in appl/ftp/ftpd/gss_userok.c in Heimdal 0.7.2 does
 not allocate memory for the ticketfile pointer before calling free, which
 allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via an invalid username. 
 NOTE: the vulnerability was originally reported for ftpd.c, but this is
 incorrect.
