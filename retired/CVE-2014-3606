Description:
 This issue was found while fuzzing PIL/pillow.  A specially crafted
 arguments passed to _imagingmath.unop() trigger crash in the native
 code of the library.
 .
 The _imagingmath is an internal helper module used by the ImageMath
 module, that is not meant to be used directly.  The unop() function
 uses its arguments as pointers, even a function pointer in case of its
 first argument.  Any use case where its called with untrusted arguments
 would allow code execution.
 .
 However, that's not how unop() is used in ImageMath, which properly
 constructs arguments for the function.  Contrary to the information in
 comment 0, observed crash is not triggered by a specially-crafted
 image, but rather caused by an incorrect function use.
