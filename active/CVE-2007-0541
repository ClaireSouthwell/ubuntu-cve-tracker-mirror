Description:
 WordPress allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary
 files, and possibly read portions of certain files, via pingback service
 calls with a source URI that corresponds to a local pathname, which
 triggers different fault codes for existing and non-existing files, and in
 certain configurations causes a brief file excerpt to be published as a
 blog comment.
