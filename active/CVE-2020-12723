Description:
 regcomp.c in Perl before 5.30.3 allows a buffer overflow via a crafted
 regular expression because of recursive S_study_chunk calls.

  An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if
  it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating
  regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the
  regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service
  attacks in this usage scenario.]
