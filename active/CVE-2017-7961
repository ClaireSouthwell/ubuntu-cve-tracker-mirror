 https://git.gnome.org/browse/libcroco/commit/?id=9ad72875e9f08e4c519ef63d44cdbd94aa9504f7
Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The cr_tknzr_parse_rgb function in cr-tknzr.c in libcroco
 0.6.11 and 0.6.12 has an "outside the range of representable values of type
 long" undefined behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a crafted CSS file. NOTE: third-party analysis reports "This is
 not a security issue in my view. The conversion surely is truncating the
 double into a long value, but there is no impact as the value is one of the
 RGB components."
