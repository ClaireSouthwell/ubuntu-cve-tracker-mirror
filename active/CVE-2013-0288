Description:
 nss-pam-ldapd before 0.7.18 and 0.8.x before 0.8.11 allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by performing a name lookup on
 an application with a large number of open file descriptors, which triggers
 a stack-based buffer overflow related to incorrect use of the FD_SET macro.
