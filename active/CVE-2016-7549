Description:
 Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.113 does not ensure that the recipient of a
 certain IPC message is a valid RenderFrame or RenderWidget, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference
 and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
 leveraging access to a renderer process, related to
 render_frame_host_impl.cc and render_widget_host_impl.cc, as demonstrated
 by a Password Manager message.
