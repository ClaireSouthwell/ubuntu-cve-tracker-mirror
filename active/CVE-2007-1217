Description:
 Buffer overflow in the bufprint function in capiutil.c in libcapi, as used
 in Linux kernel 2.6.9 to 2.6.20 and isdn4k-utils, allows local users to
 cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly gain privileges via a
 crafted CAPI packet.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 kees> This doesn't appear exploitable unless debugging has been enabled
    and the other physical end of the ISDN connection is the attacker.
