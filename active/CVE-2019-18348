Description:
 An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.17 and urllib
 in Python 3.x through 3.8.0. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker
 controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to
 urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the host component of a
 URL) followed by an HTTP header. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query
 string issue and the CVE-2019-9947 path string issue. (This is not
 exploitable when glibc has CVE-2016-10739 fixed.)
