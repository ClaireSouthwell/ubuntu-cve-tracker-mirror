Description: 
 The default auth.conf allows an authenticated node to submit a report
 for any other node, which is a problem for compliance. It should be
 more restrictive by default so that a node is only allowed to save its
 own report.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> Upstream no longer supports 0.25.x as found in lucid. The code
 mdeslaur> is substantially different, rendering a backport of this
 mdeslaur> security update difficult. Since puppet in Lucid is almost
 mdeslaur> end-of-life, we aren't planning on backporting the security fix
 mdeslaur> to it. For Lucid users, we recommend using puppet
 mdeslaur> 2.7.1-1ubuntu3.8~ubuntu10.04.1 currently in lucid-backports.
