Description:
 The backend driver in Xen 3.x allows guest OS users to cause a denial of
 service via a kernel thread leak, which prevents the device and guest OS
 from being shut down or create a zombie domain, causes a hang in zenwatch,
 or prevents unspecified xm commands from working properly, related to (1)
 netback, (2) blkback, or (3) blktap.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 The vulnerability described by CVE-2010-3699 probably exists, but I've
 not been able to reproduce it. It likely requires more block and network
 devices then I have at my disposal.
 Checked out http://xenbits.xensource.com/linux-2.6.18-xen.hg and
 compared. Not all of the original upstream patch was appropriate
 since it caused a regression with udev.
