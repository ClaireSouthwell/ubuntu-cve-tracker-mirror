Description:
 The base64DecodeInternal function in wtf/text/Base64.cpp in Blink, as used
 in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.116, does not properly handle string data
 composed exclusively of whitespace characters, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a
 window.atob method call.
