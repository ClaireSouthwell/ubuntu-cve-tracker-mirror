Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit PV guest OS
 users to gain guest OS privileges by installing and using descriptors.
 There is missing descriptor table limit checking in x86 PV emulation. When
 emulating certain PV guest operations, descriptor table accesses are
 performed by the emulating code. Such accesses should respect the guest
 specified limits, unless otherwise guaranteed to fail in such a case.
 Without this, emulation of 32-bit guest user mode calls through call gates
 would allow guest user mode to install and then use descriptors of their
 choice, as long as the guest kernel did not itself install an LDT. (Most
 OSes don't install any LDT by default). 32-bit PV guest user mode can
 elevate its privileges to that of the guest kernel. Xen versions from at
 least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only 32-bit PV guest user mode can leverage
 this vulnerability. HVM, PVH, as well as 64-bit PV guests cannot leverage
 this vulnerability. Arm systems are unaffected.
