Description:
 The Safe (aka Safe.pm) module before 2.25 for Perl allows context-dependent
 attackers to bypass intended (1) Safe::reval and (2) Safe::rdo access
 restrictions, and inject and execute arbitrary code, via vectors involving
 implicitly called methods and implicitly blessed objects, as demonstrated
 by the (a) DESTROY and (b) AUTOLOAD methods, related to "automagic
 methods."
