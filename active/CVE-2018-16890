Description:
 libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap
 buffer out-of-bounds read. The function handling incoming NTLM type-2
 messages (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate
 incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow
 vulnerability. Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could
 trick libcurl to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead
 to a buffer read out-of-bounds.
