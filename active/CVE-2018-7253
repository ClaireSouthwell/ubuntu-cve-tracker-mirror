Description:
 The ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig function of the cli/dsdiff.c file of WavPack
 5.1.0 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service (heap-based
 buffer over-read) or possibly overwrite the heap via a maliciously crafted
 DSDIFF file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 leosilva> DSDIFF support was added in 5.* version, so neither xenial or
 leosilva> trust is affected since code is not present.
