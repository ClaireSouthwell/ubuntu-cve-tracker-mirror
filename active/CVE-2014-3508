Description: 
 Information leak in pretty printing functions. A flaw in OBJ_obj2txt may
 cause pretty printing functions such as X509_name_oneline,
 X509_name_print_ex et al. to leak some information from the stack.
 Applications may be affected if they echo pretty printing output to the
 attacker. OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers themselves are not affected.
