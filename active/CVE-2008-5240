Description:
 xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and earlier versions, relies on an
 untrusted input value to determine the memory allocation and does not check
 the result for (1) the MATROSKA_ID_TR_CODECPRIVATE track entry element
 processed by demux_matroska.c; and (2) PROP_TAG, (3) MDPR_TAG, and (4)
 CONT_TAG chunks processed by the real_parse_headers function in
 demux_real.c; which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (NULL pointer dereference and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via
 a crafted value.
