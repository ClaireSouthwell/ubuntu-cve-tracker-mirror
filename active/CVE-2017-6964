Description: 
 dmcrypt-get-device does not properly handle errors returned from
 setuid()/setgid() despite being a setuid-root binary. Although it looks to be
 handling trustworthy input from the kernel after the setuid()/setgid() calls,
 the intent is to be parsing the data as a non-root user.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 tyhicks> The dmcrypt-get-device binary is built from a patch the Debian/Ubuntu
  carry. It isn't likely to affect other distros.
