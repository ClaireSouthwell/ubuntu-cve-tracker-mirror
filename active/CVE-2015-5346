Candidate: CVE-2015-5346

Description:
 When recycling the Request object to use for a new request, the
 requestedSessionSSL field was not recycled. This meant that a session ID
 provided in the next request to be processed using the recycled Request
 object could be used when it should not have been. This gave the client
 the ability to control the session ID. In theory, this could have been
 used as part of a session fixation attack but it would have been hard
 to achieve as the attacker would not have been able to force the victim
 to use the 'correct' Request object. It was also necessary for at least
 one web application to be configured to use the SSL session ID as the
 HTTP session ID. This is not a common configuration.
