Description:
 The ucnv_io_getConverterName function in common/ucnv_io.cpp in
 International Components for Unicode (ICU), as used in Google Chrome before
 44.0.2403.89, mishandles converter names with initial x- substrings, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (read of uninitialized
 memory) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.
