Description:
 MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.7.x and 1.8.x through 1.8.3 does not properly
 determine the acceptability of checksums, which might allow remote
 attackers to forge GSS tokens, gain privileges, or have unspecified other
 impact via (1) an unkeyed checksum, (2) an unkeyed PAC checksum, or (3) a
 KrbFastArmoredReq checksum based on an RC4 key.
