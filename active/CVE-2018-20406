Description:
 Modules/_pickle.c in Python before 3.7.1 has an integer overflow via a
 large LONG_BINPUT value that is mishandled during a "resize to twice the
 size" attempt. This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is only
 relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or hundreds of
 gigabytes of data.
