Description: 
 Google security researcher Abhishek Arya used the Address Sanitizer tool to
 uncover four issues: two use-after-free problems, one out of bounds read bug,
 and a bad cast. The first use-after-free problem is caused when an array of
 nsSMILTimeValueSpec objects is destroyed but attempts are made to call into
 objects in this array later. The second use-after-free problem is in
 nsDocument::AdoptNode when it adopts into an empty document and then adopts
 into another document, emptying the first one. The heap buffer overflow is in
 ElementAnimations when data is read off of end of an array and then pointers
 are dereferenced. The bad cast happens when nsTableFrame::InsertFrames is
 called with frames in aFrameList that are a mix of row group frames and column
 group frames. AppendFrames is not able to handle this mix.
