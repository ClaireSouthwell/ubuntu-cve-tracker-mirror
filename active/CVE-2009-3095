Description:
 The mod_proxy_ftp module in the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers
 to bypass intended access restrictions and send arbitrary commands to an
 FTP server via vectors related to the embedding of these commands in the
 Authorization HTTP header, as demonstrated by a certain module in VulnDisco
 Pack Professional 8.11.  NOTE: as of 20090903, this disclosure has no
 actionable information. However, because the VulnDisco Pack author is a
 reliable researcher, the issue is being assigned a CVE identifier for
 tracking purposes.
