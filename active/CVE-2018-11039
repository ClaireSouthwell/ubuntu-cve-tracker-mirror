Description:
 Spring Framework (versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.7, versions 4.3.x prior to
 4.3.18, and older unsupported versions) allow web applications to change
 the HTTP request method to any HTTP method (including TRACE) using the
 HiddenHttpMethodFilter in Spring MVC. If an application has a pre-existing
 XSS vulnerability, a malicious user (or attacker) can use this filter to
 escalate to an XST (Cross Site Tracing) attack.
