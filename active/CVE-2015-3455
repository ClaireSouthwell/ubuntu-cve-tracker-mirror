Description:
 Squid HTTP Proxy configured with client-first SSL bumping does not
 correctly validate server certificate hostname fields. As a result
 malicious server responses can wrongly be presented through the proxy
 to clients as secure authenticated HTTPS responses.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> only an issue if squid3 is built with --enable-ssl, which isn't
 mdeslaur> the case on debian/ubuntu for licensing reasons.
 mdeslaur> However, we should probably fix this anyway as rebuilding
 mdeslaur> the Ubuntu package locally to enable ssl is a common scenario.
