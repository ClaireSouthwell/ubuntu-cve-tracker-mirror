Description:
 The PRNG implementation for the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module 1.1.1 does not
 perform auto-seeding during the FIPS self-test, which generates random data
 that is more predictable than expected and makes it easier for attackers to
 bypass protection mechanisms that rely on the randomness.
