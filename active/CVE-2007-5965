Description:
 QSslSocket in Trolltech Qt 4.3.0 through 4.3.2 does not properly verify SSL
 certificates, which might make it easier for remote attackers to trick a
 user into accepting an invalid server certificate for a spoofed service, or
 trick a service into accepting an invalid client certificate for a user.
