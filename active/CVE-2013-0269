Description:
 When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in to
 creating Ruby symbols in a target system. Since Ruby symbols are not
 garbage collected, this can result in a denial of service attack. The
 same technique can be used to create objects in a target system that
 act like internal objects. These "act alike" objects can be used to
 bypass certain security mechanisms and can be used as a spring board
 for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails.
