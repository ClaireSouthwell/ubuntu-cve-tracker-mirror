Description:
 OpenSAML 2.x before 2.2.1 and XMLTooling 1.x before 1.2.1, as used by
 Internet2 Shibboleth Service Provider 2.x before 2.2.1, do not follow the
 KeyDescriptor element's Use attribute, which allows remote attackers to use
 a certificate for both signing and encryption when it is designated for
 just one purpose, potentially weakening the intended security application
 of the certificate.
