Description:
 browser/renderer_host/database_dispatcher_host.cc in Google Chrome before
 5.0.375.70 on Linux does not properly handle ViewHostMsg_DatabaseOpenFile
 messages in chroot-based sandboxing, which allows remote attackers to
 bypass intended sandbox restrictions via vectors involving fchdir and chdir
 calls.
