Description: 
 Apache: Limited cross-site scripting in mod_proxy. A limited
 cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy
 error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be
 malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only
 be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was
 misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.
