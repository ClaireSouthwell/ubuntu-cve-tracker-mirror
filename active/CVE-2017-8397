Description:
 The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in
 GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 1 and an
 invalid write of size 1 during processing of a corrupt binary containing
 reloc(s) with negative addresses. This vulnerability causes programs that
 conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as
 objdump, to crash.
