Description: 
 An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is possible in the above versions of
 OpenOffice.org. This vulnerability exploits the way in which external entities
 are processed in certain XML components of ODF documents. By crafting an
 external entity to refer to other local file system resources, an attacker
 would be able to inject contents of other locally- accessible files into the
 ODF document, without the user's knowledge or permission. Data leakage then
 becomes possible when that document is later distributed to other parties.
