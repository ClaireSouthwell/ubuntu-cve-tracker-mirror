Description: 
 Stefan Bühler discovered that the Debian specific configuration file for
 lighttpd webserver FastCGI PHP support used a fixed socket name in the
 world-writable /tmp directory. A symlink attack or a race condition could be
 exploited by a malicious user on the same machine to take over the PHP control
 socket and for example force the webserver to use a different PHP version.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> socket file was /tmp/php.socket. This should be protected by symlink
  restrictions in Ubuntu 11.10 and higher
