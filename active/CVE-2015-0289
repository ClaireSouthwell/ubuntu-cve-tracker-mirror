Description:
 The PKCS#7 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r,
 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not properly handle a
 lack of outer ContentInfo, which allows attackers to cause a denial of
 service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) by leveraging an
 application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and providing malformed
 data with ASN.1 encoding, related to crypto/pkcs7/pk7_doit.c and
 crypto/pkcs7/pk7_lib.c.
