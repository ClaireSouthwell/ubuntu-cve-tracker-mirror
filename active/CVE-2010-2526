Description:
 The cluster logical volume manager daemon (clvmd) in lvm2-cluster in LVM2
 before 2.02.72, as used in Red Hat Global File System (GFS) and other
 products, does not verify client credentials upon a socket connection,
 which allows local users to cause a denial of service (daemon exit or
 logical-volume change) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
 crafted control commands.
