Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the open_man_file function in callbacks.c in
 gmanedit 0.4.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted man page, which is not properly handled during utf8 conversion. 
 NOTE: another overflow was reported using a configuration file, but that
 vector does not have a scenario that crosses privilege boundaries.
