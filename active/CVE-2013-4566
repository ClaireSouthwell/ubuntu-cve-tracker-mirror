Description:
 A flaw was found in the way NSSVerifyClient was handled when used in both
 server / vhost context as well as directory context (specified either
 via <Directory> or <Location> directive). If 'NSSVerifyClient none'
 was set in the server / vhost context (i.e. when server is configured to
 not request or require client certificate authentication on the initial
 connection), and client certificate authentication was expected to be
 required for a specific directory via 'NSSVerifyClient require' setting,
 mod_nss failed to properly require expected certificate authentication.
 Remote attacker able to connect to the web server using such mod_nss
 configuration and without a valid client certificate could possibly
 use this flaw to access content of the restricted directories.
