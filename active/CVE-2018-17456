Description:
 Security flaw allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting
 a malicious .gitmodules file in a project cloned with
 --recurse-submodules.
 In addition to fixing the security issue for the user running "clone",
 the 2.17.2, 2.18.1 and 2.19.1 releases have an "fsck" check which can
 be used to detect such malicious repository content when fetching or
 accepting a push. See "transfer.fsckObjects" in git-config(1).
