Description:
 Dibbler 0.6.0 does not verify that certain length parameters are
 appropriate for buffer sizes, which allows remote attackers to trigger a
 buffer over-read and cause a denial of service (daemon crash), as
 demonstrated by incorrect behavior of the TSrvMsg constructor in
 SrvMessages/SrvMsg.cpp when (1) reading the option code and option length
 and (2) parsing options.
