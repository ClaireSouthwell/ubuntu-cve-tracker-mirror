Description:
 systemd-tmpfiles in systemd through 237 mishandles symlinks present in
 non-terminal path components, which allows local users to obtain ownership
 of arbitrary files via vectors involving creation of a directory and a file
 under that directory, and later replacing that directory with a symlink.
 This occurs even if the fs.protected_symlinks sysctl is turned on.
