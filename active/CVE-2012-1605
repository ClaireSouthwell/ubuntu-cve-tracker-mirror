Description:
 Due to a missing signature (HMAC) for a request argument, an attacker could
 unserialize arbitrary objects within TYPO3.

 To our knowledge it is neither possible to inject code through this
 vulnerability, nor are there exploitable objects within the TYPO3 Core.
 However, there might be exploitable objects within third party extensions.
