Description:
 The Developer Tools (aka DevTools) subsystem in Google Chrome before
 48.0.2564.109 does not validate URL schemes and ensure that the remoteBase
 parameter is associated with a chrome-devtools-frontend.appspot.com URL,
 which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a
 crafted URL, related to browser/devtools/devtools_ui_bindings.cc and
 WebKit/Source/devtools/front_end/Runtime.js.
