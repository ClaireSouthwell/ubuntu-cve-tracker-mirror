Description:
 In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier DSA signature
 generation is vulnerable to timing attack. Where timings can be closely
 observed for the generation of signatures, the lack of blinding in 1.55, or
 earlier, may allow an attacker to gain information about the signature's k
 value and ultimately the private value as well.
