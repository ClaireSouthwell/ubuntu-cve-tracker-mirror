Description:
 a cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
 flaws were found in the way DokuWiki, a standards compliant, simple
 to use Wiki, performed sanitization of the 'target' parameter when
 preprocessing edit form data. A remote attacker could provide a
 specially-crafted URL, which once visited by a valid DokuWiki user
 would lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the context
 of logged in DokuWiki user.
