Candidate: CVE-2007-6077

Description:
 The session fixation protection mechanism in cgi_process.rb in Rails 1.2.4,
 as used in Ruby on Rails, removes the :cookie_only attribute from the
 DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS constant, which effectively causes cookie_only to
 be applied only to the first instantiation of CgiRequest, which allows
 remote attackers to conduct session fixation attacks.  NOTE: this is due to
 an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380.
