Description:
 Drupal core's Image module allows for the on-demand generation of image
 derivatives. This capability can be abused by requesting a large number
 of new derivatives which can fill up the server disk space, and which
 can cause a very high CPU load. Either of these effects may lead to the
 site becoming unavailable or unresponsive.
