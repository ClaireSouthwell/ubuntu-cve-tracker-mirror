 https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2019-security-releases/
Description:
 An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing an HTTP or
 HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by sending headers very slowly
 thereby keeping the connection and associated resources alive for a long
 period of time. Attack potential is mitigated by the use of a load balancer
 or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121,
 addressed in November and impacts all active Node.js release lines
 including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and
 11.x before 11.10.1.
