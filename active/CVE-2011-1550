Description:
 The default configuration of logrotate on SUSE openSUSE Factory uses root
 privileges to process files in directories that permit non-root write
 access, which allows local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks
 by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted directories, as
 demonstrated by directories for the (1) cobbler, (2) inn, (3)
 safte-monitor, and (4) uucp packages.
