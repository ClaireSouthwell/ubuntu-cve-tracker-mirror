Description:
 net/core/net_namespace.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.32 and earlier does not
 properly handle a high rate of creation and cleanup of network namespaces,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory consumption) via requests to a daemon that requires a separate
 namespace per connection, as demonstrated by vsftpd.
