Description:
 An issue was discovered in PHP through 7.2.2. The php-fpm master process
 restarts a child process in an endless loop when using program execution
 functions (e.g., passthru, exec, shell_exec, or system) with a non-blocking
 STDIN stream, causing this master process to consume 100% of the CPU, and
 consume disk space with a large volume of error logs, as demonstrated by an
 attack by a customer of a shared-hosting facility.
