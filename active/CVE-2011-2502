Description: 
 It was found that SystemTap did not perform proper module path sanity
 checking if a user specified a custom path to the uprobes module, used
 when performing user-space probing ("staprun -u"). A local user who is a
 member of the stapusr group could use this flaw to bypass intended
 module-loading restrictions, allowing them to escalate their privileges by
 loading an arbitrary, unsigned module.
