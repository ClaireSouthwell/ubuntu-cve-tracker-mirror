Description:
 An issue was discovered in BusyBox before 1.30.0. An out of bounds read in
 udhcp components (consumed by the DHCP server, client, and relay) allows a
 remote attacker to leak sensitive information from the stack by sending a
 crafted DHCP message. This is related to verification in udhcp_get_option()
 in networking/udhcp/common.c that 4-byte options are indeed 4 bytes.
