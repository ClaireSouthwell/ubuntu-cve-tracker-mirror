Description:
 In Xpdf 4.01.01, a heap-based buffer over-read could be triggered in
 strncpy from FoFiType1::parse in fofi/FoFiType1.cc because it does not
 ensure the source string has a valid length before making a fixed-length
 copy. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document
 to the pdftotext tool. It allows an attacker to use a crafted pdf file to
 cause Denial of Service or an information leak, or possibly have
 unspecified other impact.
