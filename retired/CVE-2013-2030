Description:
 keystone/middleware/auth_token.py in OpenStack Nova Folsom, Grizzly, and
 Havana uses an insecure temporary directory for storing signing
 certificates, which allows local users to spoof servers by pre-creating
 this directory, which is reused by Nova, as demonstrated using
 /tmp/keystone-signing-nova on Fedora.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and lower not affected
 jdstrand> /tmp/keystone-signing-nova is created but it is owned by the nova
  user and symlink restrictions are in effect.
 jdstrand> upstream fix is to change /etc/nova/api-paste.ini. Since this issue
  is mitigated by symlink restrictions, ignoring since a config file change is
  too intrusive
