Description: 
 The parameter parsing code of Ruby on Rails allows applications
 to automatically cast values from strings to certain data types.
 Unfortunately the type casting code supported certain conversions which
 were not suitable for performing on user-provided data including creating
 Symbols and parsing YAML.  These unsuitable conversions can be used by
 an attacker to compromise a Rails application.
