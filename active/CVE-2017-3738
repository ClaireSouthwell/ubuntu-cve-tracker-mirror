Description: 
 There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure
 used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected.
 Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect
 would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks
 against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work
 necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline.
 The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
 However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share
 the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option
 since CVE-2016-0701.
