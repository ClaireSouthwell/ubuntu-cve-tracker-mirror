Description:
 In at least the qemu implementation of virDomainGetXMLDesc, the use of
 the flag VIR_DOMAIN_XML_MIGRATABLE (which is usable from a read-only
 connection) triggers the implicit use of VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE prior to
 calling qemuDomainFormatXML. However, the use of VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE
 is supposed to be restricted to read-write clients only. A remote
 attacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could
 use this flaw to cause leak certain limited information from the domain
 xml file.
