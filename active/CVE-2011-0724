Description: 
 live media included private keys
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Stéphane Graber discovered that the iTALC private keys shipped with the
 Edubuntu Live media were not correctly regenerated once Edubuntu was
 installed. If an iTALC client was installed with the vulnerable keys,
 a remote attacker could gain control of the system.
