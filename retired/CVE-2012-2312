Description:
 Security context propagation was not properly implemented. As
 a result, when a thread gets re-used from the thread pool, it
 still retains the security context from the process that last used
 it. The new security context is not properly propagated, and hence
 the previous security context will be in effect. A local attacker
 can use this flaw to escalate privileges in a malicious application
 deployed to the JBoss server.
