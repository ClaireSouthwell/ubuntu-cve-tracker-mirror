Description:
 In Puma before versions 3.12.2 and 4.3.1, a poorly-behaved client could use
 keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of
 service attack. If more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there
 are threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if the
 attacker sends requests frequently enough. This vulnerability is patched in
 Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2.
