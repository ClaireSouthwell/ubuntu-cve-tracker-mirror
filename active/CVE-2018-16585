Description:
 An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24. The
 .setdistillerkeys PostScript command is accepted even though it is not
 intended for use during document processing (e.g., after the startup
 phase). This leads to memory corruption, allowing remote attackers able to
 supply crafted PostScript to crash the interpreter or possibly have
 unspecified other impact.
