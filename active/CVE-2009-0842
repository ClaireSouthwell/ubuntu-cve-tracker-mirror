Description:
 mapserv in MapServer 4.x before 4.10.4 and 5.x before 5.2.2 allows remote
 attackers to read arbitrary invalid .map files via a full pathname in the
 map parameter, which triggers the display of partial file contents within
 an error message, as demonstrated by a /tmp/sekrut.map symlink.
