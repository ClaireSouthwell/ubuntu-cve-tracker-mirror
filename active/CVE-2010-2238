Description:
 It was found that libvirt did not extract the defined disk backing store
 format when recursing into disk image backing stores in the security
 drivers. This could be possibly exploited by priviledged guest user to
 access arbitrary files on the host.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes: 
 jdstrand> AppArmor in Ubuntu 10.04 should mostly protect the host OS, but
  an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another
  machine.
 jdstrand> upstream patch is highly intrusive, needs rewriting for all affected
  releases, requires a conffile change and a migration helper.
