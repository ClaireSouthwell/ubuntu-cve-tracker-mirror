Description:
 cURL and libcurl 7.18.0 through 7.32.0, when built with OpenSSL, disables
 the certificate CN and SAN name field verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST)
 when the digital signature verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER) is
 disabled, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via
 an arbitrary valid certificate.
