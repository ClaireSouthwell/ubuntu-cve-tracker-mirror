Description: 
 Scheduler denial of service through scheduler_hints

 Dan Prince from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova scheduler
 nodes. By creating servers with malicious scheduler_hints, an
 authenticated user may generate a huge amount of database calls,
 potentially resulting in a Denial of Service attack against Nova
 scheduler nodes. Only setups exposing the OpenStack API and enabling
 DifferentHostFilter and/or SameHostFilter are affected.
