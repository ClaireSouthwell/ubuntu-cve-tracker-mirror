Description:
 An issue was discovered in the merge_strings function in merge.c in the
 Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU
 Binutils 2.31. There is a NULL pointer dereference in
 _bfd_add_merge_section when attempting to merge sections with large
 alignments. A specially crafted ELF allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service, as demonstrated by ld.
