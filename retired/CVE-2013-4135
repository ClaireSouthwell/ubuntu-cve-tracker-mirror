Description: 
 The -encrypt option to the 'vos' volume management command should cause
 it to encrypt all data between client and server. However, in versions
 of OpenAFS later than 1.6.0, it has no effect, and data is transmitted
 with integrity protection only. In all versions of OpenAFS, vos -encrypt
 has no effect when combined with the -localauth option.
