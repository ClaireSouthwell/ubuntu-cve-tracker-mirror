Description:
 The AudioParamTimeline::AudioNodeInputValue function in the Web Audio
 implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 39.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before
 38.1 does not properly calculate an oscillator rendering range, which
 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory
 or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.
