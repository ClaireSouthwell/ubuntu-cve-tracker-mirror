Description:
 A bug has been discovered in the GetStatistics64 RPC which can trigger
 a fileserver crash. The version argument of the GetStatistics64 RPC
 is used to determine how much memory is allocated for the RPC reply.
 However the range of this argument is not validated, allowing an attacker
 to cause insufficient memory to be allocated for the statistical
 information reply buffer. The GetStatistics64 RPC requests do not
 require authentication.
