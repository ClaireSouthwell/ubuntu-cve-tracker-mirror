Description:
 If an ACL file is empty, or has only blank lines or comments, then mosquitto
 treats the ACL file as not being defined, which means that no topic access is
 denied. Although denying access to all topics is not a useful configuration,
 this behaviour is unexpected and could lead to access being incorrectly
 granted in some circumstances.
