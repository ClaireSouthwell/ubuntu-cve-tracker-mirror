Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Upstream is not backporting the sizelimit middleware to Folsom or
  Essex because it is too intrusive
 jdstrand> requires keystone to be directly exposed to incoming POST messages
  and not protected by a proxy
 jdstrand> see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1155566/comments/14 for
  mitigation strategies
