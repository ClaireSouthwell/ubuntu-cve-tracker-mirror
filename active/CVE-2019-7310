Description:
 In Poppler 0.73.0, a heap-based buffer over-read (due to an integer
 signedness error in the XRef::getEntry function in XRef.cc) allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document, as demonstrated by
 pdftocairo.
