Description:
 KRandom::random() Small Space of Random Values
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> This CVE is for an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2120, which
  means that it only really applies to packages where the upstream fix
  for CVE-2013-2120 was used. I believe that is only raring-proposed as
  of 2013-06-26, but I'm marking this needed for all releases, to ensure
  the incorrect fix is not used alone.
