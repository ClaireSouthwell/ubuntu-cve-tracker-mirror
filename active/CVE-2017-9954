Description:
 The getvalue function in tekhex.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
 library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer over-read and
 application crash) via a crafted tekhex file, as demonstrated by
 mishandling within the nm program.
