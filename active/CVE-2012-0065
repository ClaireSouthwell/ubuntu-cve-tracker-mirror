Description: 
 rigan has reported a vulnerability in usbmuxd, which potentially can be
 exploited by malicious people with physical access to compromise a
 vulnerable system. The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error
 within the "receive_packet()" function (libusbmuxd/libusbmuxd.c) when
 processing a property list containing an overly long "SerialNumber" field,
 which can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow. Successful
 exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code, but requires that
 the attacker is able to connect a malicious USB device.
