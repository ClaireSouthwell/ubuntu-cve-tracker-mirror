Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow exists in the
 'BKE_mesh_calc_normals_tessface' functionality of the Blender open-source
 3d creation suite. A specially crafted .blend file can cause an integer
 overflow resulting in a buffer overflow which can allow for code execution
 under the context of the application. An attacker can convince a user to
 open a .blend file in order to trigger this vulnerability.
