Description:
 android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java in
 Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65 on Android does not properly restrict use
 of a URL's fragment identifier during construction of a page-info popup,
 which allows remote attackers to spoof the URL bar or deliver misleading
 popup content via crafted text.
