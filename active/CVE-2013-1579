Description:
 The rtps_util_add_bitmap function in epan/dissectors/packet-rtps.c in the
 RTPS dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 does
 not properly implement certain nested loops for processing bitmap data,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop)
 via a malformed packet.
