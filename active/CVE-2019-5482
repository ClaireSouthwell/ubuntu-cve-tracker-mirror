Description:
 [libcurl >= 7.19.4 to and including 7.65.3 contains a heap buffer overflow
 in the function tftp_receive_packet() that receives data from a TFTP
 server. It can call recvfrom() with the default size for the buffer rather
 than with the size that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that
 might overwrite the heap memory is controlled by the server.]
