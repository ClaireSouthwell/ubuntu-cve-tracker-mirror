Description:
 Multiple integer overflow issues were found in the implementation of
 Buffers in the java.nio (Non-blocking I/O) packages in the Libraries
 component of OpenJDK.  These could lead to out of bounds buffer access
 and Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.  An untursted Java
 application or applet could use these flaws to run arbitrary code with
 the Java Virtual Machine privileges or bypass Java sandbox
 restrictions.
