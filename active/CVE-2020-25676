 https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1732
Description:
 In CatromWeights(), MeshInterpolate(), InterpolatePixelChannel(),
 InterpolatePixelChannels(), and InterpolatePixelInfo(), which are all
 functions in /MagickCore/pixel.c, there were multiple unconstrained pixel
 offset calculations which were being used with the floor() function. These
 calculations produced undefined behavior in the form of out-of-range and
 integer overflows, as identified by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. These
 instances of undefined behavior could be triggered by an attacker who is
 able to supply a crafted input file to be processed by ImageMagick. These
 issues could impact application availability or potentially cause other
 problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick
 versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
