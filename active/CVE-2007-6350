Description:
 scponly 4.6 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to bypass
 intended restrictions and execute code by invoking dangerous subcommands
 including (1) unison, (2) rsync, and (3) svn , as originally demonstrated
 by creating a Subversion (SVN) repository with malicious hooks, then using
 svn to trigger execution of those hooks.
