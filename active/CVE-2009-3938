Description:
 Buffer overflow in the ABWOutputDev::endWord function in
 poppler/ABWOutputDev.cc in Poppler (aka libpoppler) 0.10.6, 0.12.0, and
 possibly other versions, as used by the Abiword pdftoabw utility, allows
 user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> as of 2010-01-18, upstream hasn't committed a fix yet
 mdeslaur> debian released patch from bug, but it's not final
 mdeslaur> intrepid+ compiler hardening reduces this to a denial of
 mdeslaur> service. Can't reproduce issue on Hardy. Setting to "low".
 mdeslaur> seems we don't carry the patch that Debian is carrying for this.
