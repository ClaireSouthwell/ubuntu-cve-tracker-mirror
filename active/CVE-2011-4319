Description: 
 A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the
 'translate' helper method of the Ruby on Rails performed HTML
 escaping of interpolated user input, when interpolation in
 combination with HTML-safe translations were used. A remote
 attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary HTML or web
 script by providing a specially-crafted input to Ruby on Rails
 application, using the ActionPack module and its 'translate'
 helper method without explicit (application specific) sanitization
 of user provided input.
