Description: 
 It was found that libvirt did not honour the user defined main disk format
 in guest XML when looking up disk backing stores in the security drivers.
 This could be possibly exploited by priviledged guest user to access arbitrary
 files on the host.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> AppArmor in Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 should protect the host OS, but
  an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another
  machine.
 jdstrand> upstream patch is highly intrusive, needs rewriting for all affected   releases, requires a conffile change and potentially a migration helper.
