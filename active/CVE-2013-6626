Description:
 The WebContentsImpl::AttachInterstitialPage function in
 content/browser/web_contents/web_contents_impl.cc in Google Chrome before
 31.0.1650.48 does not cancel JavaScript dialogs upon generating an
 interstitial warning, which allows remote attackers to spoof the address
 bar via a crafted web site.
