 https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/blob/373ea760f21701b162e8c4912a66928ee30d401a/ChangeLog
Description:
 PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using
 an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or
 public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force
 attacks to obtain the private key.
