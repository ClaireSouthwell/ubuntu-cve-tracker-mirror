Description:
 OpenSSH through 7.7 is prone to a user enumeration vulnerability due to not
 delaying bailout for an invalid authenticating user until after the packet
 containing the request has been fully parsed, related to auth2-gss.c,
 auth2-hostbased.c, and auth2-pubkey.c.

Notes:
 sarnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
 sarnold> openssh-ssh1 is a *client-only* package, no server-side facility, so
  there is no path to leak data
 mdeslaur> watch for regressions, see debian ELA-37-3
