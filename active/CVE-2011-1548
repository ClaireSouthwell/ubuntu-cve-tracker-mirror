Description:
 The default configuration of logrotate on Debian GNU/Linux uses root
 privileges to process files in directories that permit non-root write
 access, which allows local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks
 by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted directories, as
 demonstrated by /var/log/postgresql/.

 mdeslaur> looks like issue #9, adding RH bug
 mdeslaur> upstream patch adds "su" option variable, and probably breaks
 mdeslaur> backwards compatibility
 mdeslaur> RH proposed patch for CVE-2011-1098 may fix it in a
 mdeslaur> backwards-compatible way
 mdeslaur> pretty much fixed by nofollow.patch and security-388608.patch
