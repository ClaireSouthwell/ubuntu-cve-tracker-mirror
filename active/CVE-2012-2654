Description: 
 When a security group is created via the EC2 or OS API's that uses a protocol
 defined in the incorrect case i.e 'TCP' rather than 'tcp' it causes a later
 string comparison to fail. This leads to Security Groups not being set
 correctly. Once the Nova DB has been polluted with the incorrect case any
 subsequent modifications to the security group will also fail.
