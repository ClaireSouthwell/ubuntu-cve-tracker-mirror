 Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in editor/filemanager/upload/php/upload.php
 in FCKeditor, as used in SiteX CMS 0.7.3.beta and probably other products,
 allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a file
 whose name contains ".php." and has an unknown extension, which is recognized
 as a .php file by the Apache HTTP server, a different vulnerability than
