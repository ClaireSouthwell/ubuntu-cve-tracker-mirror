Description:
 The dissect_wtp_common function in epan/dissectors/packet-wtp.c in the WTP
 dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.12 and 1.8.x before 1.8.4 uses an
 incorrect data type for a certain length field, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and infinite loop)
 via a crafted value in a packet.
