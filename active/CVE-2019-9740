 https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/http-header-injection2.html
Description:
 An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib
 in Python 3.x through 3.7.3. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker
 controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to
 urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the query string after a
 ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command.
