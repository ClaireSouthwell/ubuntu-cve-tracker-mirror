Candidate: CVE-2006-5793
References:
Description:
 The sPLT chunk handling code (png_set_sPLT function in pngset.c) in libpng
 1.0.6 through 1.2.12 uses a sizeof operator on the wrong data type, which
 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
 malformed sPLT chunks that trigger an out-of-bounds read.
