Description:
 Apache Tomcat before 6.0.40, 7.x before 7.0.54, and 8.x before 8.0.6 does
 not properly constrain the class loader that accesses the XML parser used
 with an XSLT stylesheet, which allows remote attackers to (1) read
 arbitrary files via a crafted web application that provides an XML external
 entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an
 XML External Entity (XXE) issue, or (2) read files associated with
 different web applications on a single Tomcat instance via a crafted web
 application.
