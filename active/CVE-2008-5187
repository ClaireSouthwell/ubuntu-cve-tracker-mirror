Description:
 The load function in the XPM loader for imlib2 1.4.2, and possibly other
 versions, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted XPM file that triggers a
 "pointer arithmetic error" and a heap-based buffer overflow, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2008-2426.  NOTE: the provenance of this information
 is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
