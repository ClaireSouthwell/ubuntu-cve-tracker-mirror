Description:
 Apport creates it's lock file as root owned with world-writable permissions
 in a world-writable directory (/var/lock/apport). This could allow an
 unprivileged user to escalate their privileges to root by creating a
 symlink at /var/lock/apport to redirect where the lock file is created and
 then replacing the contents of the lock file in a subsequent operation.
