Description:
 An attacker can exploit phpMyAdmin before 4.8.4 to leak the contents of a
 local file because of an error in the transformation feature. The attacker
 must have access to the phpMyAdmin Configuration Storage tables, although
 these can easily be created in any database to which the attacker has
 access. An attacker must have valid credentials to log in to phpMyAdmin;
 this vulnerability does not allow an attacker to circumvent the login
 system.
