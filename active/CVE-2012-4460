Description:
 The serializing/deserializing functions in the qpid::framing::Buffer class
 in Apache Qpid 0.20 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via unspecified vectors.  NOTE:
 this issue could also trigger an out-of-bounds read, but it might not
 trigger a crash.
