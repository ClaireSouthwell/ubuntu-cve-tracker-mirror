Description:
 In the MIT krb5 libgssapi_krb5 library, after gss_process_context_token()
 is used to process a valid context deletion token, the caller is left with
 a security context handle containing a dangling pointer.  Further uses of
 this handle will result in use-after-free and double-free memory access
 violations. libgssrpc server applications such as kadmind are vulnerable
 as they can be instructed to call gss_process_context_token().
