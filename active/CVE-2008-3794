Description:
 Integer signedness error in the mms_ReceiveCommand function in
 modules/access/mms/mmstu.c in VLC Media Player 0.8.6i allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted mmst link with a negative
 size value, which bypasses a size check and triggers an integer overflow
 followed by a heap-based buffer overflow.
