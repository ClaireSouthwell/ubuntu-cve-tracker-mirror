Description:
 A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows
 commands to be executed in a subprocess via Ruby's `Kernel.open` method.
 Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method
 `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being called with unsafe user input
 as the filename. This vulnerability appears in code generated by the
 Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to
 generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying
 vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this
 version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.
