Description:
 We've received a bug report that gnome-keyring client library does not
 instruct the daemon to discard secrets when using the
 gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync function
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> In hardy, gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync() was in the gnome-keyring
 mdeslaur> package, and works as expected.
 mdeslaur> In 2.30+ in Lucid+, gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync() is in
 mdeslaur> libgnome-keyring and sends a LockService DBus call to
 mdeslaur> gnome-keyring. This call isn't implemented in lucid+
 mdeslaur> Nothing in the archive in Oneiric+ actually uses
 mdeslaur> gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync(), so this is low.
 mdeslaur> In Lucid, gnome-power-manager calls this before suspend and
 mdeslaur> hibernation with the intention of locking the keyring.
 mdeslaur> Fixing this in Lucid would result in the user likely having to
 mdeslaur> retype their keyring password when coming out of suspend and
 mdeslaur> hibernation, which is an intrusive change this late in Lucid's
 mdeslaur> lifecycle.
 mdeslaur> Setting this issue as priority low for the reasons above.
