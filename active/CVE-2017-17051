Description:
 By repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, an authenticated
 user may consume untracked resources on a hypervisor host leading to
 a denial of service. This regression was introduced with the fix for
 OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239), however, only Nova stable/pike or
 later deployments with that fix applied and relying on the default
 FilterScheduler are affected.
