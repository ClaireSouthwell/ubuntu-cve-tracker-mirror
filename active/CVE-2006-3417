Candidate: CVE-2006-3417
References: 
Description:
 Tor client before 0.1.1.20 prefers entry points based on is_fast or
 is_stable flags, which could allow remote attackers to be preferred over
 nodes that are identified as more trustworthy "entry guard" (is_guard)
 systems by directory authorities.
