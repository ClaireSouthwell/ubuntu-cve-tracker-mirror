Description:
 Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0 of the SKS
 keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky to have a GnuPG
 keyserver configuration line referring to a host on the SKS keyserver
 network. Retrieving data from this network may cause a persistent denial of
 service, because of a Certificate Spamming Attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> this is a weakness in the PGP keyserver design.
 amurray> gnupg upstream has 2 mitigations for this - firstly, don't import
 amurray> key signatures by default anymore, and to fallback to only import
 amurray> self-signatures on very large keyblocks
 mdeslaur> as of 2019-10-17, there is no ideal fix for this issue
 mdeslaur> marking this CVE as deferred until a complete fix is available
