Description:
 A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/quantum-private.h. An
 attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could
 trigger a heap buffer overflow. This would most likely lead to an impact to
 application availability, but could potentially lead to an impact to data
 integrity as well. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
