Description: 
 An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is possible in the above versions of
 OpenOffice.org. This vulnerability exploits the way in which external entities
 are processed in certain XML components of ODF documents. By crafting an
 external entity to refer to other local file system resources, an attacker
 would be able to inject contents of other locally- accessible files into the
 ODF document, without the user's knowledge or permission. Data leakage then
 becomes possible when that document is later distributed to other parties.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Per Sweetchark, only a LibreOffice issue if using internal raptor
 jdstrand> Debian's patch for 1.4.21 from David Beckett based on patch sent to
  linux-distros@
 jdstrand> per RedHat, arbitrary code execution is possible as well
 jdstrand> 1.4.21-7 is claimed to be fixed in Debian. While a patch was added,
  the quilt series file was not updated so the patch was not applied.
