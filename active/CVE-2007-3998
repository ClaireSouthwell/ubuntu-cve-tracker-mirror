Candidate: CVE-2007-3998
References: 
Description: 
 The wordwrap function in PHP 4 before 4.4.8, and PHP 5 before 5.2.4, does not
 properly use the breakcharlen variable, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash, or infinite
 loop) via certain arguments, as demonstrated by a 'chr(0), 0, ""' argument set.
