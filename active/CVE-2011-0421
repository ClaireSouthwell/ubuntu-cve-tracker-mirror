Description:
 The _zip_name_locate function in zip_name_locate.c in the Zip extension in
 PHP before 5.3.6 does not properly handle a ZIPARCHIVE::FL_UNCHANGED
 argument, which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial
 of service (NULL pointer dereference) via an empty ZIP archive that is
 processed with a (1) locateName or (2) statName operation.
