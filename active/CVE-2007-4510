Candidate: CVE-2007-4510
References: 
Description:
 ClamAV before 0.91.2, as used in Kolab Server 2.0 through 2.2beta1 and
 other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via (1) a crafted RTF file, which triggers a NULL
 dereference in the cli_scanrtf function in libclamav/rtf.c; or (2) a
 crafted HTML document with a data: URI, which triggers a NULL dereference
 in the cli_html_normalise function in libclamav/htmlnorm.c.  NOTE: some of
 these details are obtained from third party information.
