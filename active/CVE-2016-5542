Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u121, 7u111, 8u102; and Java
 SE Embedded 8u101 allows remote attackers to affect integrity via vectors
 related to Libraries.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OpenJDK did not restrict the set of algorithms
 used for Jar integrity verification. An attacker could use this
 to modify without detection the content of a JAR file, affecting
 system integrity.
Notes:
 sbeattie> The following algorithms and key sizes are restricted in
   this release:
     - MD2 (in either the digest or signature algorithm)
     - RSA keys less than 1024 bits
   Upstream is planning to restrict MD5-based signatures in
   signed JARs in the January 2017 CPU.
   .
   The list of disabled algorithms is controlled via a new security
   property, jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms, in the java.security
   file. This property contains a list of disabled algorithms and
   key sizes for cryptographically signed JAR files.
