Description:
 The Spellcheck API implementation in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65 does
 not use an HTTPS session for downloading a Hunspell dictionary, which
 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to deliver incorrect spelling
 suggestions or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.
