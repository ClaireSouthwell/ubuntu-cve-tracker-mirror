Description:
 QPluginLoader in Qt versions 5.0.0 through 5.13.2 would search for certain 
 plugins first on the current working directory of the application, which 
 allows an attacker that can place files in the file system and influence the 
 working directory of Qt-based applications to load and execute malicious code. 
 This issue was verified on macOS and Linux and probably affects all other Unix 
 operating systems. This issue does not affect Windows.
