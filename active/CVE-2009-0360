Description:
 Russ Allbery pam-krb5 before 3.13, when linked against MIT Kerberos, does
 not properly initialize the Kerberos libraries for setuid use, which allows
 local users to gain privileges by pointing an environment variable to a
 modified Kerberos configuration file, and then launching a PAM-based setuid
 application.
