Description:
 The set_magic_quotes_runtime function in PHP 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, when the
 MySQLi extension is used, does not properly interact with use of the
 mysqli_fetch_assoc function, which might make it easier for
 context-dependent attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via crafted
 input that had been properly handled in earlier PHP versions.

 mdeslaur> we use libmysqlclient, not mysqlnd, so not affected.
