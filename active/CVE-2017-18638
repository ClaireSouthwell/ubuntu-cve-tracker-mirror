Description:
 send_email in graphite-web/webapp/graphite/composer/views.py in Graphite
 through 1.1.5 is vulnerable to SSRF. The vulnerable SSRF endpoint can be
 used by an attacker to have the Graphite web server request any resource.
 The response to this SSRF request is encoded into an image file and then
 sent to an e-mail address that can be supplied by the attacker. Thus, an
 attacker can exfiltrate any information.
