Description:
 Ansible before version 2.3 has an input validation vulnerability in the
 handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a
 client system being managed by Ansible, and the ability to send facts back
 to the Ansible server, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the
 Ansible server using the Ansible server privileges.
