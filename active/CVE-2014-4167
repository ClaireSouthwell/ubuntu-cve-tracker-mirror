Description:
 By creating an IPv6 private subnet attached to a L3 router, an
 authenticated user may break the L3-agent, preventing further floating
 IPv4 addresses from being attached for the entire cloud. Note: removal
 of the faulty network can not be done using the API and must be cleaned
 at the database level. Only Neutron setups using IPv6 and L3-agent are
 affected.
