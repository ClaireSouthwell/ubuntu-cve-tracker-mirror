Description:
 An unspecified function in the JavaScript implementation in Mozilla Firefox
 creates and exposes a "temporary footprint" when there is a current login
 to a web site, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user
 into acting upon a spoofed pop-up message, aka an "in-session phishing
 attack." NOTE: as of 20090116, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory
 with no actionable information. However, because it is from a well-known
 researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
