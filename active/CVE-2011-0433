Description: 
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way AFM font file
 parser, used for rendering of DVI files, in GNOME evince document viewer
 and other products, processed line tokens from the given input stream. 
 A remote attacker could provide a DVI file, with embedded specially-crafted 
 font file, and trick the local user to open it with an application using
 the AFM font parser, leading to that particular application crash or,
 potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
 running the application. Different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2642.
