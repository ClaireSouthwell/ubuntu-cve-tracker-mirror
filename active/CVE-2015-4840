Description:
 It was discovered that the 2D component of OpenJDK could perform out of
 bounds access and possibly disclose portions of the Java Virtual
 Machine memory when processing specially crafted color profiles.  The
 issue was caused by having bundled lcms2 code use fast floor()
 implementation.  An untrusted Java application or applet could use this
 flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.
