Description:
 It was found that the JBoss JNDI service allowed unauthenticated, remote
 write access by default. The JNDI and HA-JNDI services, and the
 HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet were all affected. A remote attacker able to
 access the JNDI service (port 1099), HA-JNDI service (port 1100), or the
 HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could use this flaw to add,
 delete, and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could have various,
 application-specific impacts.
