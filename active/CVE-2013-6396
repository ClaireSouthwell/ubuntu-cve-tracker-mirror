Description:
 does not properly verify the server SSL certificates
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> certificate verification checks are completely missing. Patch is
  intrusive and may not be applied to 13.10. Patch adds an --insecure option
  that would have to be enabled by default in the security update so as not to
  break production systems. Depending on upstream's decision, Ubuntu may only
  fix 14.04.
 jdstrand> as of 2014-02-06, upstream is debating patchset
