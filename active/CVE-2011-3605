Description: 
 A temporary denial of service flaw was found in radvd's process_rs()
 function, where it would call mdelay() on the same thread in which it
 handled all input.  If ->UnicastOnly were set, an attacker could cause a
 flood with ND_ROUTER_SOLICIT and fill the input queue of the daemon.
 This would cause a brief outage of approximately MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME / 2 *
 sizeof_input_queue when handling new clients, where MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME is
 500ms, leading to delays of more than a minute.  Note: this is only the
 case in unicast-only mode; there is no denial of service in the (normal,
 default) anycast mode.
