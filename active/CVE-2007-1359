Candidate: CVE-2007-1359
References: 
Description:
 Interpretation conflict in ModSecurity (mod_security) 2.1.0 and earlier
 allows remote attackers to bypass request rules via
 application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST data that contains an ASCIIZ (0x00)
 byte, which mod_security treats as a terminator even though it is still
 processed as normal data by some HTTP parsers including PHP 5.2.0, and
 possibly parsers in Perl, and Python.
