Description: 
 An attacker can exploit an integer overflow in libprocps's
 file2strvec() function and carry out an LPE when another user,
 administrator, or script executes a vulnerable utility (pgrep, pidof,
 pkill, and w are vulnerable by default; other utilities are vulnerable
 if executed with non-default options). Moreover, an attacker's process
 running inside a container can trigger this vulnerability in a utility
 running outside the container: the attacker can exploit this userland
 vulnerability and break out of the container or chroot. We will
 publish our proof-of-concept exploits in the near future.
