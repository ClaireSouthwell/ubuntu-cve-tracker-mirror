Description:
 When apr_time_exp*() or apr_os_exp_time*() functions are invoked with an
 invalid month field value in Apache Portable Runtime APR 1.6.2 and prior,
 out of bounds memory may be accessed in converting this value to an
 apr_time_exp_t value, potentially revealing the contents of a different
 static heap value or resulting in program termination, and may represent an
 information disclosure or denial of service vulnerability to applications
 which call these APR functions with unvalidated external input.
